3</span>THE PLANTER OF MALATA</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>In the private editorial office of the principal newspaper in
a great colonial city two men were talking.&nbsp; They were both
young.&nbsp; The stouter of the two, fair, and with more of an
urban look about him, was the editor and part-owner of the
important newspaper.</p>
<p>The other&rsquo;s name was Renouard.&nbsp; That he was
exercised in his mind about something was evident on his fine
bronzed face.&nbsp; He was a lean, lounging, active man.&nbsp;
The journalist continued the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you were dining yesterday at old
Dunster&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He used the word old not in the endearing sense in which it is
sometimes applied to intimates, but as a matter of sober
fact.&nbsp; The Dunster in question was old.&nbsp; He had been an
eminent colonial statesman, but had now retired from active
politics after a tour in Europe and a lengthy stay in England,
during which he had had a very good press indeed.&nbsp; The
colony was proud of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I dined there,&rdquo; said Renouard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Young Dunster asked me just as I was going out of his
office.&nbsp; It seemed to be like a sudden thought.&nbsp; And
yet I can&rsquo;t help suspecting some purpose behind it.&nbsp;
He was very pressing.&nbsp; He swore that his uncle would be very
pleased to see me.&nbsp; Said his uncle had mentioned lately that
the granting to me of the Malata concession was the last act of
his official life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very touching.&nbsp; The old boy sentimentalises over
the past now and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know why I accepted,&rdquo;
continued the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sentiment does not move me very
easily.&nbsp; Old Dunster was civil to me of course, but he did
not even inquire how I was getting on with my silk plants.&nbsp;
Forgot there was such a thing probably.&nbsp; I must say there
were more people there than I expected to meet.&nbsp; Quite a big
party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was asked,&rdquo; remarked the newspaper man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Only I couldn&rsquo;t go.&nbsp; But when did you arrive
from Malata?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I arrived yesterday at daylight.&nbsp; I am anchored
out there in the bay&mdash;off Garden Point.&nbsp; I was in
Dunster&rsquo;s office before he had finished reading his
letters.&nbsp; Have you ever seen young Dunster reading his
letters?&nbsp; I had a glimpse of him through the open
door.&nbsp; He holds the paper in both hands, hunches his
shoulders up to his ugly ears, and brings his long nose and his
thick lips on to it like a sucking apparatus.&nbsp; A commercial
monster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we don&rsquo;t consider him a monster,&rdquo; said
the newspaper man looking at his visitor thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not.&nbsp; You are used to see his face and to
see other faces.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how it is that, when I
come to town, the appearance of the people in the street strike
me with such force.&nbsp; They seem so awfully
expressive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not charming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;no.&nbsp; Not as a rule.&nbsp; The effect is
forcible without being clear. . . . I know that you think
it&rsquo;s because of my solitary manner of life away
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I do think so.&nbsp; It is
demoralising.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t see any one for months at a
stretch.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re leading an unhealthy life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other hardly smiled and murmured the admission that true
enough it was a good eleven months since he had been in town
last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; insisted the other.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Solitude works like a sort of poison.&nbsp; And then you
perceive suggestions in faces&mdash;mysterious and forcible, that
no sound man would be bothered with.&nbsp; Of course you
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Geoffrey Renouard did not tell his journalist friend that the
suggestions of his own face, the face of a friend, bothered him
as much as the others.&nbsp; He detected a degrading quality in
the touches of age which every day adds to a human
countenance.&nbsp; They moved and disturbed him, like the signs
of a horrible inward travail which was frightfully apparent to
the fresh eye he had brought from his isolation in Malata, where
he had settled after five strenuous years of adventure and
exploration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that when I
am at home in Malata I see no one consciously.&nbsp; I take the
plantation boys for granted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and we here take the people in the streets for
granted.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s sanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The visitor said nothing to this for fear of engaging a
discussion.&nbsp; What he had come to seek in the editorial
office was not controversy, but information.&nbsp; Yet somehow he
hesitated to approach the subject.&nbsp; Solitary life makes a
man reticent in respect of anything in the nature of gossip,
which those to whom chatting about their kind is an everyday
exercise regard as the commonest use of speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You very busy?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The Editor making red marks on a long slip of printed paper
threw the pencil down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I am done.&nbsp; Social paragraphs.&nbsp;
This office is the place where everything is known about
everybody&mdash;including even a great deal of nobodies.&nbsp;
Queer fellows drift in and out of this room.&nbsp; Waifs and
strays from home, from up-country, from the Pacific.&nbsp; And,
by the way, last time you were here you picked up one of that
sort for your assistant&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I engaged an assistant only to stop your preaching
about the evils of solitude,&rdquo; said Renouard hastily; and
the pressman laughed at the half-resentful tone.&nbsp; His laugh
was not very loud, but his plump person shook all over.&nbsp; He
was aware that his younger friend&rsquo;s deference to his advice
was based only on an imperfect belief in his wisdom&mdash;or his
sagacity.&nbsp; But it was he who had first helped Renouard in
his plans of exploration: the five-years&rsquo; programme of
scientific adventure, of work, of danger and endurance, carried
out with such distinction and rewarded modestly with the lease of
Malata island by the frugal colonial government.&nbsp; And this
reward, too, had been due to the journalist&rsquo;s advocacy with
word and pen&mdash;for he was an influential man in the
community.&nbsp; Doubting very much if Renouard really liked him,
he was himself without great sympathy for a certain side of that
man which he could not quite make out.&nbsp; He only felt it
obscurely to be his real personality&mdash;the true&mdash;and,
perhaps, the absurd.&nbsp; As, for instance, in that case of the
assistant.&nbsp; Renouard had given way to the arguments of his
friend and backer&mdash;the argument against the unwholesome
effect of solitude, the argument for the safety of companionship
even if quarrelsome.&nbsp; Very well.&nbsp; In this docility he
was sensible and even likeable.&nbsp; But what did he do
next?&nbsp; Instead of taking counsel as to the choice with his
old backer and friend, and a man, besides, knowing everybody
employed and unemployed on the pavements of the town, this
extraordinary Renouard suddenly and almost surreptitiously picked
up a fellow&mdash;God knows who&mdash;and sailed away with him
back to Malata in a hurry; a proceeding obviously rash and at the
same time not quite straight.&nbsp; That was the sort of
thing.&nbsp; The secretly unforgiving journalist laughed a little
longer and then ceased to shake all over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&nbsp; About that assistant of yours. . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about him,&rdquo; said Renouard, after waiting a
while, with a shadow of uneasiness on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you nothing to tell me of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing except. . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; Incipient grimness
vanished out of Renouard&rsquo;s aspect and his voice, while he
hesitated as if reflecting seriously before he changed his
mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;No.&nbsp; Nothing whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t brought him along with you by
chance&mdash;for a change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Planter of Malata stared, then shook his head, and finally
murmured carelessly: &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s very well where he
is.&nbsp; But I wish you could tell me why young Dunster insisted
so much on my dining with his uncle last night.&nbsp; Everybody
knows I am not a society man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Editor exclaimed at so much modesty.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t
his friend know that he was their one and only
explorer&mdash;that he was the man experimenting with the silk
plant. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, that doesn&rsquo;t tell me why I was invited
yesterday.&nbsp; For young Dunster never thought of this civility
before. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Willie,&rdquo; said the popular journalist,
&ldquo;never does anything without a purpose, that&rsquo;s a
fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to his uncle&rsquo;s house too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He lives there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; But he might have given me a feed somewhere
else.&nbsp; The extraordinary part is that the old man did not
seem to have anything special to say.&nbsp; He smiled kindly on
me once or twice, and that was all.&nbsp; It was quite a party,
sixteen people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Editor then, after expressing his regret that he had not
been able to come, wanted to know if the party had been
entertaining.</p>
<p>Renouard regretted that his friend had not been there.&nbsp;
Being a man whose business or at least whose profession was to
know everything that went on in this part of the globe, he could
probably have told him something of some people lately arrived
from home, who were amongst the guests.&nbsp; Young Dunster
(Willie), with his large shirt-front and streaks of white skin
shining unpleasantly through the thin black hair plastered over
the top of his head, bore down on him and introduced him to that
party, as if he had been a trained dog or a child
phenomenon.&nbsp; Decidedly, he said, he disliked
Willie&mdash;one of these large oppressive men. . . .</p>
<p>A silence fell, and it was as if Renouard were not going to
say anything more when, suddenly, he came out with the real
object of his visit to the editorial room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They looked to me like people under a spell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Editor gazed at him appreciatively, thinking that, whether
the effect of solitude or not, this was a proof of a sensitive
perception of the expression of faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You omitted to tell me their name, but I can make a
guess.&nbsp; You mean Professor Moorsom, his daughter and
sister&mdash;don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard assented.&nbsp; Yes, a white-haired lady.&nbsp; But
from his silence, with his eyes fixed, yet avoiding his friend,
it was easy to guess that it was not in the white-haired lady
that he was interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; he said, recovering his usual
bearing.&nbsp; &ldquo;It looks to me as if I had been asked there
only for the daughter to talk to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not conceal that he had been greatly struck by her
appearance.&nbsp; Nobody could have helped being impressed.&nbsp;
She was different from everybody else in that house, and it was
not only the effect of her London clothes.&nbsp; He did not take
her down to dinner.&nbsp; Willie did that.&nbsp; It was
afterwards, on the terrace. . . .</p>
<p>The evening was delightfully calm.&nbsp; He was sitting apart
and alone, and wishing himself somewhere else&mdash;on board the
schooner for choice, with the dinner-harness off.&nbsp; He
hadn&rsquo;t exchanged forty words altogether during the evening
with the other guests.&nbsp; He saw her suddenly all by herself
coming towards him along the dimly lighted terrace, quite from a
distance.</p>
<p>She was tall and supple, carrying nobly on her straight body a
head of a character which to him appeared peculiar,
something&mdash;well&mdash;pagan, crowned with a great wealth of
hair.&nbsp; He had been about to rise, but her decided approach
caused him to remain on the seat.&nbsp; He had not looked much at
her that evening.&nbsp; He had not that freedom of gaze acquired
by the habit of society and the frequent meetings with
strangers.&nbsp; It was not shyness, but the reserve of a man not
used to the world and to the practice of covert staring, with
careless curiosity.&nbsp; All he had captured by his first, keen,
instantly lowered, glance was the impression that her hair was
magnificently red and her eyes very black.&nbsp; It was a
troubling effect, but it had been evanescent; he had forgotten it
almost till very unexpectedly he saw her coming down the terrace
slow and eager, as if she were restraining herself, and with a
rhythmic upward undulation of her whole figure.&nbsp; The light
from an open window fell across her path, and suddenly all that
mass of arranged hair appeared incandescent, chiselled and fluid,
with the daring suggestion of a helmet of burnished copper and
the flowing lines of molten metal.&nbsp; It kindled in him an
astonished admiration.&nbsp; But he said nothing of it to his
friend the Editor.&nbsp; Neither did he tell him that her
approach woke up in his brain the image of love&rsquo;s infinite
grace and the sense of the inexhaustible joy that lives in
beauty.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; What he imparted to the Editor were no
emotions, but mere facts conveyed in a deliberate voice and in
uninspired words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That young lady came and sat down by me.&nbsp; She
said: &lsquo;Are you French, Mr. Renouard?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had breathed a whiff of perfume of which he said nothing
either&mdash;of some perfume he did not know.&nbsp; Her voice was
low and distinct.&nbsp; Her shoulders and her bare arms gleamed
with an extraordinary splendour, and when she advanced her head
into the light he saw the admirable contour of the face, the
straight fine nose with delicate nostrils, the exquisite crimson
brushstroke of the lips on this oval without colour.&nbsp; The
expression of the eyes was lost in a shadowy mysterious play of
jet and silver, stirring under the red coppery gold of the hair
as though she had been a being made of ivory and precious metals
changed into living tissue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . I told her my people were living in Canada, but
that I was brought up in England before coming out here.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t imagine what interest she could have in my
history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you complain of her interest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The accent of the all-knowing journalist seemed to jar on the
Planter of Malata.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he said, in a deadened voice that was almost
sullen.&nbsp; But after a short silence he went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Very extraordinary.&nbsp; I told her I came out to wander
at large in the world when I was nineteen, almost directly after
I left school.&nbsp; It seems that her late brother was in the
same school a couple of years before me.&nbsp; She wanted me to
tell her what I did at first when I came out here; what other men
found to do when they came out&mdash;where they went, what was
likely to happen to them&mdash;as if I could guess and foretell
from my experience the fates of men who come out here with a
hundred different projects, for hundreds of different
reasons&mdash;for no reason but restlessness&mdash;who come, and
go, and disappear!&nbsp; Preposterous.&nbsp; She seemed to want
to hear their histories.&nbsp; I told her that most of them were
not worth telling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The distinguished journalist leaning on his elbow, his head
resting against the knuckles of his left hand, listened with
great attention, but gave no sign of that surprise which
Renouard, pausing, seemed to expect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know something,&rdquo; the latter said
brusquely.&nbsp; The all-knowing man moved his head slightly and
said, &ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; But go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just this.&nbsp; There is no more to
it.&nbsp; I found myself talking to her of my adventures, of my
early days.&nbsp; It couldn&rsquo;t possibly have interested
her.&nbsp; Really,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;this is most
extraordinary.&nbsp; Those people have something on their
minds.&nbsp; We sat in the light of the window, and her father
prowled about the terrace, with his hands behind his back and his
head drooping.&nbsp; The white-haired lady came to the
dining-room window twice&mdash;to look at us I am certain.&nbsp;
The other guests began to go away&mdash;and still we sat
there.&nbsp; Apparently these people are staying with the
Dunsters.&nbsp; It was old Mrs. Dunster who put an end to the
thing.&nbsp; The father and the aunt circled about as if they
were afraid of interfering with the girl.&nbsp; Then she got up
all at once, gave me her hand, and said she hoped she would see
me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was speaking Renouard saw again the sway of her
figure in a movement of grace and strength&mdash;felt the
pressure of her hand&mdash;heard the last accents of the deep
murmur that came from her throat so white in the light of the
window, and remembered the black rays of her steady eyes passing
off his face when she turned away.&nbsp; He remembered all this
visually, and it was not exactly pleasurable.&nbsp; It was rather
startling like the discovery of a new faculty in himself.&nbsp;
There are faculties one would rather do without&mdash;such, for
instance, as seeing through a stone wall or remembering a person
with this uncanny vividness.&nbsp; And what about those two
people belonging to her with their air of expectant
solicitude!&nbsp; Really, those figures from home got in front of
one.&nbsp; In fact, their persistence in getting between him and
the solid forms of the everyday material world had driven
Renouard to call on his friend at the office.&nbsp; He hoped that
a little common, gossipy information would lay the ghost of that
unexpected dinner-party.&nbsp; Of course the proper person to go
to would have been young Dunster, but, he couldn&rsquo;t stand
Willie Dunster&mdash;not at any price.</p>
<p>In the pause the Editor had changed his attitude, faced his
desk, and smiled a faint knowing smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Striking girl&mdash;eh?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The incongruity of the word was enough to make one jump out of
the chair.&nbsp; Striking!&nbsp; That girl striking!&nbsp; Stri .
. .!&nbsp; But Renouard restrained his feelings.&nbsp; His friend
was not a person to give oneself away to.&nbsp; And, after all,
this sort of speech was what he had come there to hear.&nbsp; As,
however, he had made a movement he re-settled himself comfortably
and said, with very creditable indifference, that yes&mdash;she
was, rather.&nbsp; Especially amongst a lot of over-dressed
frumps.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t one woman under forty there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the way to speak of the cream of our society;
the &lsquo;top of the basket,&rsquo; as the French say,&rdquo;
the Editor remonstrated with mock indignation.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
aren&rsquo;t moderate in your expressions&mdash;you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I express myself very little,&rdquo; interjected
Renouard seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you what you are.&nbsp; You are a fellow
that doesn&rsquo;t count the cost.&nbsp; Of course you are safe
with me, but will you never learn. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What struck me most,&rdquo; interrupted the other,
&ldquo;is that she should pick me out for such a long
conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s perhaps because you were the most
remarkable of the men there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This shot doesn&rsquo;t seem to me to hit the
mark,&rdquo; he said calmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Try again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe me?&nbsp; Oh, you modest
creature.&nbsp; Well, let me assure you that under ordinary
circumstances it would have been a good shot.&nbsp; You are
sufficiently remarkable.&nbsp; But you seem a pretty acute
customer too.&nbsp; The circumstances are extraordinary.&nbsp; By
Jove they are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He mused.&nbsp; After a time the Planter of Malata dropped a
negligent&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you know them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I know them,&rdquo; assented the all-knowing
Editor, soberly, as though the occasion were too special for a
display of professional vanity; a vanity so well known to
Renouard that its absence augmented his wonder and almost made
him uneasy as if portending bad news of some sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have met those people?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I was to have met them last night, but I had
to send an apology to Willie in the morning.&nbsp; It was then
that he had the bright idea to invite you to fill the place, from
a muddled notion that you could be of use.&nbsp; Willie is stupid
sometimes.&nbsp; For it is clear that you are the last man able
to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How on earth do I come to be mixed up in
this&mdash;whatever it is?&rdquo;&nbsp; Renouard&rsquo;s voice
was slightly altered by nervous irritation.&nbsp; &ldquo;I only
arrived here yesterday morning.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>His friend the Editor turned to him squarely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Willie took me into consultation, and since he seems to
have let you in I may just as well tell you what is up.&nbsp; I
shall try to be as short as I can.&nbsp; But in
confidence&mdash;mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited.&nbsp; Renouard, his uneasiness growing on him
unreasonably, assented by a nod, and the other lost no time in
beginning.&nbsp; Professor Moorsom&mdash;physicist and
philosopher&mdash;fine head of white hair, to judge from the
photographs&mdash;plenty of brains in the head too&mdash;all
these famous books&mdash;surely even Renouard would know. . .
.</p>
<p>Renouard muttered moodily that it wasn&rsquo;t his sort of
reading, and his friend hastened to assure him earnestly that
neither was it his sort&mdash;except as a matter of business and
duty, for the literary page of that newspaper which was his
property (and the pride of his life).&nbsp; The only literary
newspaper in the Antipodes could not ignore the fashionable
philosopher of the age.&nbsp; Not that anybody read Moorsom at
the Antipodes, but everybody had heard of him&mdash;women,
children, dock labourers, cabmen.&nbsp; The only person (besides
himself) who had read Moorsom, as far as he knew, was old
Dunster, who used to call himself a Moorsomian (or was it
Moorsomite) years and years ago, long before Moorsom had worked
himself up into the great swell he was now, in every way. . .
Socially too.&nbsp; Quite the fashion in the highest world.</p>
<p>Renouard listened with profoundly concealed attention.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A charlatan,&rdquo; he muttered languidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;no.&nbsp; I should say not.&nbsp; I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder though if most of his writing had been
done with his tongue in his cheek.&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s to be expected.&nbsp; I tell you what: the only
really honest writing is to be found in newspapers and nowhere
else&mdash;and don&rsquo;t you forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Editor paused with a basilisk stare till Renouard had
conceded a casual: &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; and only then went
on to explain that old Dunster, during his European tour, had
been made rather a lion of in London, where he stayed with the
Moorsoms&mdash;he meant the father and the girl.&nbsp; The
professor had been a widower for a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t look just a girl,&rdquo; muttered
Renouard.&nbsp; The other agreed.&nbsp; Very likely not.&nbsp;
Had been playing the London hostess to tip-top people ever since
she put her hair up, probably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect to see any girlish bloom on her
when I do have the privilege,&rdquo; he continued.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Those people are staying with the Dunster&rsquo;s
<i>incog.</i>, in a manner, you understand&mdash;something like
royalties.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t deceive anybody, but they want
to be left to themselves.&nbsp; We have even kept them out of the
paper&mdash;to oblige old Dunster.&nbsp; But we shall put your
arrival in&mdash;our local celebrity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Mr. G. Renouard, the explorer, whose
indomitable energy, etc., and who is now working for the
prosperity of our country in another way on his Malata plantation
. . . And, by the by, how&rsquo;s the silk
plant&mdash;flourishing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you bring any fibre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Schooner-full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&nbsp; To be transhipped to Liverpool for
experimental manufacture, eh?&nbsp; Eminent capitalists at home
very much interested, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A silence fell.&nbsp; Then the Editor uttered
slowly&mdash;&ldquo;You will be a rich man some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard&rsquo;s face did not betray his opinion of that
confident prophecy.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t say anything till his
friend suggested in the same meditative voice&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to interest Moorsom in the affair
too&mdash;since Willie has let you in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A philosopher!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he isn&rsquo;t above making a bit of
money.&nbsp; And he may be clever at it for all you know.&nbsp; I
have a notion that he&rsquo;s a fairly practical old cove. . . .
Anyhow,&rdquo; and here the tone of the speaker took on a tinge
of respect, &ldquo;he has made philosophy pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard raised his eyes, repressed an impulse to jump up, and
got out of the arm-chair slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
perhaps a bad idea,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have
to call there in any case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wondered whether he had managed to keep his voice steady,
its tone unconcerned enough; for his emotion was strong though it
had nothing to do with the business aspect of this
suggestion.&nbsp; He moved in the room in vague preparation for
departure, when he heard a soft laugh.&nbsp; He spun about
quickly with a frown, but the Editor was not laughing at
him.&nbsp; He was chuckling across the big desk at the wall: a
preliminary of some speech for which Renouard, recalled to
himself, waited silent and mistrustful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; You would never guess!&nbsp; No one would
ever guess what these people are after.&nbsp; Willie&rsquo;s eyes
bulged out when he came to me with the tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They always do,&rdquo; remarked Renouard with
disgust.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was startled.&nbsp; And so was I after he told
me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a search party.&nbsp; They are out looking
for a man.&nbsp; Willie&rsquo;s soft heart&rsquo;s enlisted in
the cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard repeated: &ldquo;Looking for a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down suddenly as if on purpose to stare.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did Willie come to you to borrow the lantern,&rdquo; he
asked sarcastically, and got up again for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What lantern?&rdquo; snapped the puzzled Editor, and
his face darkened with suspicion.&nbsp; &ldquo;You, Renouard, are
always alluding to things that aren&rsquo;t clear to me.&nbsp; If
you were in politics, I, as a party journalist, wouldn&rsquo;t
trust you further than I could see you.&nbsp; Not an inch
further.&nbsp; You are such a sophisticated beggar.&nbsp; Listen:
the man is the man Miss Moorsom was engaged to for a year.&nbsp;
He couldn&rsquo;t have been a nobody, anyhow.&nbsp; But he
doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been very wise.&nbsp; Hard luck for
the young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke with feeling.&nbsp; It was clear that what he had to
tell appealed to his sentiment.&nbsp; Yet, as an experienced man
of the world, he marked his amused wonder.&nbsp; Young man of
good family and connections, going everywhere, yet not merely a
man about town, but with a foot in the two big F&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Renouard lounging aimlessly in the room turned round:
&ldquo;And what the devil&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he asked
faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Fashion and Finance,&rdquo; explained the
Editor.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I call it.&nbsp; There are
the three R&rsquo;s at the bottom of the social edifice and the
two F&rsquo;s on the top.&nbsp; See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Ha!&nbsp; Excellent!&nbsp; Ha! Ha!&rdquo; Renouard
laughed with stony eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you proceed from one set to the other in this
democratic age,&rdquo; the Editor went on with unperturbed
complacency.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is if you are clever enough.&nbsp;
The only danger is in being too clever.&nbsp; And I think
something of the sort happened here.&nbsp; That swell I am
speaking of got himself into a mess.&nbsp; Apparently a very ugly
mess of a financial character.&nbsp; You will understand that
Willie did not go into details with me.&nbsp; They were not
imparted to him with very great abundance either.&nbsp; But a bad
mess&mdash;something of the criminal order.&nbsp; Of course he
was innocent.&nbsp; But he had to quit all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Ha!&rdquo; Renouard laughed again abruptly, staring
as before.&nbsp; &ldquo;So there&rsquo;s one more big F in the
tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; inquired the Editor quickly,
with an air as if his patent were being infringed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean&mdash;Fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t say that.&nbsp; I
wouldn&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;let him be a scoundrel then.&nbsp; What the
devil do I care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But hold on!&nbsp; You haven&rsquo;t heard the end of
the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard, his hat on his head already, sat down with the
disdainful smile of a man who had discounted the moral of the
story.&nbsp; Still he sat down and the Editor swung his revolving
chair right round.&nbsp; He was full of unction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imprudent, I should say.&nbsp; In many ways money is as
dangerous to handle as gunpowder.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t be too
careful either as to who you are working with.&nbsp; Anyhow there
was a mighty flashy burst up, a sensation, and&mdash;his familiar
haunts knew him no more.&nbsp; But before he vanished he went to
see Miss Moorsom.&nbsp; That very fact argues for his
innocence&mdash;don&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; What was said between them
no man knows&mdash;unless the professor had the confidence from
his daughter.&nbsp; There couldn&rsquo;t have been much to
say.&nbsp; There was nothing for it but to let him go&mdash;was
there?&mdash;for the affair had got into the papers.&nbsp; And
perhaps the kindest thing would have been to forget him.&nbsp;
Anyway the easiest.&nbsp; Forgiveness would have been more
difficult, I fancy, for a young lady of spirit and position drawn
into an ugly affair like that.&nbsp; Any ordinary young lady, I
mean.&nbsp; Well, the fellow asked nothing better than to be
forgotten, only he didn&rsquo;t find it easy to do so himself,
because he would write home now and then.&nbsp; Not to any of his
friends though.&nbsp; He had no near relations.&nbsp; The
professor had been his guardian.&nbsp; No, the poor devil wrote
now and then to an old retired butler of his late father,
somewhere in the country, forbidding him at the same time to let
any one know of his whereabouts.&nbsp; So that worthy old ass
would go up and dodge about the Moorsom&rsquo;s town house,
perhaps waylay Miss Moorsom&rsquo;s maid, and then would write to
&lsquo;Master Arthur&rsquo; that the young lady looked well and
happy, or some such cheerful intelligence.&nbsp; I dare say he
wanted to be forgotten, but I shouldn&rsquo;t think he was much
cheered by the news.&nbsp; What would you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard, his legs stretched out and his chin on his breast,
said nothing.&nbsp; A sensation which was not curiosity, but
rather a vague nervous anxiety, distinctly unpleasant, like a
mysterious symptom of some malady, prevented him from getting up
and going away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mixed feelings,&rdquo; the Editor opined.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Many fellows out here receive news from home with mixed
feelings.&nbsp; But what will his feelings be when he hears what
I am going to tell you now?&nbsp; For we know he has not heard
yet.&nbsp; Six months ago a city clerk, just a common drudge of
finance, gets himself convicted of a common embezzlement or
something of that kind.&nbsp; Then seeing he&rsquo;s in for a
long sentence he thinks of making his conscience comfortable, and
makes a clean breast of an old story of tampered with, or else
suppressed, documents, a story which clears altogether the
honesty of our ruined gentleman.&nbsp; That embezzling fellow was
in a position to know, having been employed by the firm before
the smash.&nbsp; There was no doubt about the character being
cleared&mdash;but where the cleared man was nobody could
tell.&nbsp; Another sensation in society.&nbsp; And then Miss
Moorsom says: &lsquo;He will come back to claim me, and
I&rsquo;ll marry him.&rsquo;&nbsp; But he didn&rsquo;t come
back.&nbsp; Between you and me I don&rsquo;t think he was much
wanted&mdash;except by Miss Moorsom.&nbsp; I imagine she&rsquo;s
used to have her own way.&nbsp; She grew impatient, and declared
that if she knew where the man was she would go to him.&nbsp; But
all that could be got out of the old butler was that the last
envelope bore the postmark of our beautiful city; and that this
was the only address of &lsquo;Master Arthur&rsquo; that he ever
had.&nbsp; That and no more.&nbsp; In fact the fellow was at his
last gasp&mdash;with a bad heart.&nbsp; Miss Moorsom wasn&rsquo;t
allowed to see him.&nbsp; She had gone herself into the country
to learn what she could, but she had to stay downstairs while the
old chap&rsquo;s wife went up to the invalid.&nbsp; She brought
down the scrap of intelligence I&rsquo;ve told you of.&nbsp; He
was already too far gone to be cross-examined on it, and that
very night he died.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t leave behind him much
to go by, did he?&nbsp; Our Willie hinted to me that there had
been pretty stormy days in the professor&rsquo;s house,
but&mdash;here they are.&nbsp; I have a notion she isn&rsquo;t
the kind of everyday young lady who may be permitted to gallop
about the world all by herself&mdash;eh?&nbsp; Well, I think it
rather fine of her, but I quite understand that the professor
needed all his philosophy under the circumstances.&nbsp; She is
his only child now&mdash;and brilliant&mdash;what?&nbsp; Willie
positively spluttered trying to describe her to me; and I could
see directly you came in that you had an uncommon
experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard, with an irritated gesture, tilted his hat more
forward on his eyes, as though he were bored.&nbsp; The Editor
went on with the remark that to be sure neither he (Renouard) nor
yet Willie were much used to meet girls of that remarkable
superiority.&nbsp; Willie when learning business with a firm in
London, years before, had seen none but boarding-house society,
he guessed.&nbsp; As to himself in the good old days, when he
trod the glorious flags of Fleet Street, he neither had access
to, nor yet would have cared for the swells.&nbsp; Nothing
interested him then but parliamentary politics and the oratory of
the House of Commons.</p>
<p>He paid to this not very distant past the tribute of a tender,
reminiscent smile, and returned to his first idea that for a
society girl her action was rather fine.&nbsp; All the same the
professor could not be very pleased.&nbsp; The fellow if he was
as pure as a lily now was just about as devoid of the goods of
the earth.&nbsp; And there were misfortunes, however undeserved,
which damaged a man&rsquo;s standing permanently.&nbsp; On the
other hand, it was difficult to oppose cynically a noble
impulse&mdash;not to speak of the great love at the root of
it.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Love!&nbsp; And then the lady was quite
capable of going off by herself.&nbsp; She was of age, she had
money of her own, plenty of pluck too.&nbsp; Moorsom must have
concluded that it was more truly paternal, more prudent too, and
generally safer all round to let himself be dragged into this
chase.&nbsp; The aunt came along for the same reasons.&nbsp; It
was given out at home as a trip round the world of the usual
kind.</p>
<p>Renouard had risen and remained standing with his heart
beating, and strangely affected by this tale, robbed as it was of
all glamour by the prosaic personality of the narrator.&nbsp; The
Editor added: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been asked to help in the
search&mdash;you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard muttered something about an appointment and went out
into the street.&nbsp; His inborn sanity could not defend him
from a misty creeping jealousy.&nbsp; He thought that obviously
no man of that sort could be worthy of such a woman&rsquo;s
devoted fidelity.&nbsp; Renouard, however, had lived long enough
to reflect that a man&rsquo;s activities, his views, and even his
ideas may be very inferior to his character; and moved by a
delicate consideration for that splendid girl he tried to think
out for the man a character of inward excellence and outward
gifts&mdash;some extraordinary seduction.&nbsp; But in
vain.&nbsp; Fresh from months of solitude and from days at sea,
her splendour presented itself to him absolutely unconquerable in
its perfection, unless by her own folly.&nbsp; It was easier to
suspect her of this than to imagine in the man qualities which
would be worthy of her.&nbsp; Easier and less degrading.&nbsp;
Because folly may be generous&mdash;could be nothing else but
generosity in her; whereas to imagine her subjugated by something
common was intolerable.</p>
<p>Because of the force of the physical impression he had
received from her personality (and such impressions are the real
origins of the deepest movements of our soul) this conception of
her was even inconceivable.&nbsp; But no Prince Charming has ever
lived out of a fairy tale.&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t walk the worlds
of Fashion and Finance&mdash;and with a stumbling gait at
that.&nbsp; Generosity.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; It was her
generosity.&nbsp; But this generosity was altogether regal in its
splendour, almost absurd in its lavishness&mdash;or, perhaps,
divine.</p>
<p>In the evening, on board his schooner, sitting on the rail,
his arms folded on his breast and his eyes fixed on the deck, he
let the darkness catch him unawares in the midst of a meditation
on the mechanism of sentiment and the springs of passion.&nbsp;
And all the time he had an abiding consciousness of her bodily
presence.&nbsp; The effect on his senses had been so penetrating
that in the middle of the night, rousing up suddenly, wide-eyed
in the darkness of his cabin, he did not create a faint mental
vision of her person for himself, but, more intimately affected,
he scented distinctly the faint perfume she used, and could
almost have sworn that he had been awakened by the soft rustle of
her dress.&nbsp; He even sat up listening in the dark for a time,
then sighed and lay down again, not agitated but, on the
contrary, oppressed by the sensation of something that had
happened to him and could not be undone.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>In the afternoon he lounged into the editorial office,
carrying with affected nonchalance that weight of the
irremediable he had felt laid on him suddenly in the small hours
of the night&mdash;that consciousness of something that could no
longer be helped.&nbsp; His patronising friend informed him at
once that he had made the acquaintance of the Moorsom party last
night.&nbsp; At the Dunsters, of course.&nbsp; Dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very quiet.&nbsp; Nobody there.&nbsp; It was much
better for the business.&nbsp; I say . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard, his hand grasping the back of a chair, stared down
at him dumbly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a stunning girl. . . Why do
you want to sit on that chair?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
uncomfortable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going to sit on it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Renouard walked slowly to the window, glad to find in himself
enough self-control to let go the chair instead of raising it on
high and bringing it down on the Editor&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willie kept on gazing at her with tears in his boiled
eyes.&nbsp; You should have seen him bending sentimentally over
her at dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Renouard in such an anguished
tone that the Editor turned right round to look at his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You push your dislike of young Dunster too far.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s positively morbid,&rdquo; he disapproved mildly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t be all beautiful after thirty. . . . I
talked a little, about you mostly, to the professor.&nbsp; He
appeared to be interested in the silk plant&mdash;if only as a
change from the great subject.&nbsp; Miss Moorsom didn&rsquo;t
seem to mind when I confessed to her that I had taken you into
the confidence of the thing.&nbsp; Our Willie approved too.&nbsp;
Old Dunster with his white beard seemed to give me his
blessing.&nbsp; All those people have a great opinion of you,
simply because I told them that you&rsquo;ve led every sort of
life one can think of before you got struck on exploration.&nbsp;
They want you to make suggestions.&nbsp; What do you think
&lsquo;Master Arthur&rsquo; is likely to have taken
to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something easy,&rdquo; muttered Renouard without
unclenching his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hunting man.&nbsp; Athlete.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be hard
on the chap.&nbsp; He may be riding boundaries, or droving
cattle, or humping his swag about the back-blocks away to the
devil&mdash;somewhere.&nbsp; He may be even prospecting at the
back of beyond&mdash;this very moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or lying dead drunk in a roadside pub.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
late enough in the day for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Editor looked up instinctively.&nbsp; The clock was
pointing at a quarter to five.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; he
admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it needn&rsquo;t be.&nbsp; And he may
have lit out into the Western Pacific all of a sudden&mdash;say
in a trading schooner.&nbsp; Though I really don&rsquo;t see in
what capacity.&nbsp; Still . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or he may be passing at this very moment under this
very window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not he . . . and I wish you would get away from it to
where one can see your face.&nbsp; I hate talking to a
man&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; You stand there like a hermit on a
sea-shore growling to yourself.&nbsp; I tell you what it is,
Geoffrey, you don&rsquo;t like mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t make my living by talking about
mankind&rsquo;s affairs,&rdquo; Renouard defended himself.&nbsp;
But he came away obediently and sat down in the arm-chair.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How can you be so certain that your man isn&rsquo;t down
there in the street?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
neither more nor less probable than every single one of your
other suppositions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Placated by Renouard&rsquo;s docility the Editor gazed at him
for a while.&nbsp; &ldquo;Aha!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you
how.&nbsp; Learn then that we have begun the campaign.&nbsp; We
have telegraphed his description to the police of every township
up and down the land.&nbsp; And what&rsquo;s more we&rsquo;ve
ascertained definitely that he hasn&rsquo;t been in this town for
the last three months at least.&nbsp; How much longer he&rsquo;s
been away we can&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very curious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very simple.&nbsp; Miss Moorsom wrote to
him, to the post office here directly she returned to London
after her excursion into the country to see the old butler.&nbsp;
Well&mdash;her letter is still lying there.&nbsp; It has not been
called for.&nbsp; Ergo, this town is not his usual abode.&nbsp;
Personally, I never thought it was.&nbsp; But he cannot fail to
turn up some time or other.&nbsp; Our main hope lies just in the
certitude that he must come to town sooner or later.&nbsp;
Remember he doesn&rsquo;t know that the butler is dead, and he
will want to inquire for a letter.&nbsp; Well, he&rsquo;ll find a
note from Miss Moorsom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard, silent, thought that it was likely enough.&nbsp; His
profound distaste for this conversation was betrayed by an air of
weariness darkening his energetic sun-tanned features, and by the
augmented dreaminess of his eyes.&nbsp; The Editor noted it as a
further proof of that immoral detachment from mankind, of that
callousness of sentiment fostered by the unhealthy conditions of
solitude&mdash;according to his own favourite theory.&nbsp; Aloud
he observed that as long as a man had not given up correspondence
he could not be looked upon as lost.&nbsp; Fugitive criminals had
been tracked in that way by justice, he reminded his friend; then
suddenly changed the bearing of the subject somewhat by asking if
Renouard had heard from his people lately, and if every member of
his large tribe was well and happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tone was curt, as if repelling a liberty.&nbsp; Renouard
did not like being asked about his people, for whom he had a
profound and remorseful affection.&nbsp; He had not seen a single
human being to whom he was related, for many years, and he was
extremely different from them all.</p>
<p>On the very morning of his arrival from his island he had gone
to a set of pigeon-holes in Willie Dunster&rsquo;s outer office
and had taken out from a compartment labelled
&ldquo;Malata&rdquo; a very small accumulation of envelopes, a
few addressed to himself, and one addressed to his assistant, all
to the care of the firm, W. Dunster and Co.&nbsp; As opportunity
offered, the firm used to send them on to Malata either by a
man-of-war schooner going on a cruise, or by some trading craft
proceeding that way.&nbsp; But for the last four months there had
been no opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You going to stay here some time?&rdquo; asked the
Editor, after a longish silence.</p>
<p>Renouard, perfunctorily, did see no reason why he should make
a long stay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For health, for your mental health, my boy,&rdquo;
rejoined the newspaper man.&nbsp; &ldquo;To get used to human
faces so that they don&rsquo;t hit you in the eye so hard when
you walk about the streets.&nbsp; To get friendly with your
kind.&nbsp; I suppose that assistant of yours can be trusted to
look after things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the half-caste too.&nbsp; The
Portuguese.&nbsp; He knows what&rsquo;s to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo;&nbsp; The Editor looked sharply at his
friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The assistant&rsquo;s you picked up on the sly behind
my back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard made a slight movement of impatience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met him unexpectedly one evening.&nbsp; I thought he
would do as well as another.&nbsp; He had come from up country
and didn&rsquo;t seem happy in a town.&nbsp; He told me his name
was Walter.&nbsp; I did not ask him for proofs, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you get on very well with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&nbsp; What makes you think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Something reluctant in your
manner when he&rsquo;s in question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really.&nbsp; My manner!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think
he&rsquo;s a great subject for conversation, perhaps.&nbsp; Why
not drop him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t confess to a
mistake.&nbsp; Not you.&nbsp; Nevertheless I have my suspicions
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard got up to go, but hesitated, looking down at the
seated Editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How funny,&rdquo; he said at last with the utmost
seriousness, and was making for the door, when the voice of his
friend stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what has been said of you?&nbsp; That you
couldn&rsquo;t get on with anybody you couldn&rsquo;t kick.&nbsp;
Now, confess&mdash;is there any truth in the soft
impeachment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Renouard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you print
that in your paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t quite believe it.&nbsp; But I
will tell you what I believe.&nbsp; I believe that when your
heart is set on some object you are a man that doesn&rsquo;t
count the cost to yourself or others.&nbsp; And this shall get
printed some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obituary notice?&rdquo; Renouard dropped
negligently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certain&mdash;some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you then regard yourself as immortal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my boy.&nbsp; I am not immortal.&nbsp; But the
voice of the press goes on for ever. . . . And it will say that
this was the secret of your great success in a task where better
men than you&mdash;meaning no offence&mdash;did fail
repeatedly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Success,&rdquo; muttered Renouard, pulling-to the
office door after him with considerable energy.&nbsp; And the
letters of the word PRIVATE like a row of white eyes seemed to
stare after his back sinking down the staircase of that temple of
publicity.</p>
<p>Renouard had no doubt that all the means of publicity would be
put at the service of love and used for the discovery of the
loved man.&nbsp; He did not wish him dead.&nbsp; He did not wish
him any harm.&nbsp; We are all equipped with a fund of humanity
which is not exhausted without many and repeated
provocations&mdash;and this man had done him no evil.&nbsp; But
before Renouard had left old Dunster&rsquo;s house, at the
conclusion of the call he made there that very afternoon, he had
discovered in himself the desire that the search might last
long.&nbsp; He never really flattered himself that it might
fail.&nbsp; It seemed to him that there was no other course in
this world for himself, for all mankind, but resignation.&nbsp;
And he could not help thinking that Professor Moorsom had arrived
at the same conclusion too.</p>
<p>Professor Moorsom, slight frame of middle height, a thoughtful
keen head under the thick wavy hair, veiled dark eyes under
straight eyebrows, and with an inward gaze which when disengaged
and arriving at one seemed to issue from an obscure dream of
books, from the limbo of meditation, showed himself extremely
gracious to him.&nbsp; Renouard guessed in him a man whom an
incurable habit of investigation and analysis had made gentle and
indulgent; inapt for action, and more sensitive to the thoughts
than to the events of existence.&nbsp; Withal not crushed,
sub-ironic without a trace of acidity, and with a simple manner
which put people at ease quickly.&nbsp; They had a long
conversation on the terrace commanding an extended view of the
town and the harbour.</p>
<p>The splendid immobility of the bay resting under his gaze,
with its grey spurs and shining indentations, helped Renouard to
regain his self-possession, which he had felt shaken, in coming
out on the terrace, into the setting of the most powerful emotion
of his life, when he had sat within a foot of Miss Moorsom with
fire in his breast, a humming in his ears, and in a complete
disorder of his mind.&nbsp; There was the very garden seat on
which he had been enveloped in the radiant spell.&nbsp; And
presently he was sitting on it again with the professor talking
of her.&nbsp; Near by the patriarchal Dunster leaned forward in a
wicker arm-chair, benign and a little deaf, his big hand to his
ear with the innocent eagerness of his advanced age remembering
the fires of life.</p>
<p>It was with a sort of apprehension that Renouard looked
forward to seeing Miss Moorsom.&nbsp; And strangely enough it
resembled the state of mind of a man who fears disenchantment
more than sortilege.&nbsp; But he need not have been
afraid.&nbsp; Directly he saw her in a distance at the other end
of the terrace he shuddered to the roots of his hair.&nbsp; With
her approach the power of speech left him for a time.&nbsp; Mrs.
Dunster and her aunt were accompanying her.&nbsp; All these
people sat down; it was an intimate circle into which Renouard
felt himself cordially admitted; and the talk was of the great
search which occupied all their minds.&nbsp; Discretion was
expected by these people, but of reticence as to the object of
the journey there could be no question.&nbsp; Nothing but ways
and means and arrangements could be talked about.</p>
<p>By fixing his eyes obstinately on the ground, which gave him
an air of reflective sadness, Renouard managed to recover his
self-possession.&nbsp; He used it to keep his voice in a low key
and to measure his words on the great subject.&nbsp; And he took
care with a great inward effort to make them reasonable without
giving them a discouraging complexion.&nbsp; For he did not want
the quest to be given up, since it would mean her going away with
her two attendant grey-heads to the other side of the world.</p>
<p>He was asked to come again, to come often and take part in the
counsels of all these people captivated by the sentimental
enterprise of a declared love.&nbsp; On taking Miss
Moorsom&rsquo;s hand he looked up, would have liked to say
something, but found himself voiceless, with his lips suddenly
sealed.&nbsp; She returned the pressure of his fingers, and he
left her with her eyes vaguely staring beyond him, an air of
listening for an expected sound, and the faintest possible smile
on her lips.&nbsp; A smile not for him, evidently, but the
reflection of some deep and inscrutable thought.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p>He went on board his schooner.&nbsp; She lay white, and as if
suspended, in the crepuscular atmosphere of sunset mingling with
the ashy gleam of the vast anchorage.&nbsp; He tried to keep his
thoughts as sober, as reasonable, as measured as his words had
been, lest they should get away from him and cause some sort of
moral disaster.&nbsp; What he was afraid of in the coming night
was sleeplessness and the endless strain of that wearisome
task.&nbsp; It had to be faced however.&nbsp; He lay on his back,
sighing profoundly in the dark, and suddenly beheld his very own
self, carrying a small bizarre lamp, reflected in a long mirror
inside a room in an empty and unfurnished palace.&nbsp; In this
startling image of himself he recognised somebody he had to
follow&mdash;the frightened guide of his dream.&nbsp; He
traversed endless galleries, no end of lofty halls, innumerable
doors.&nbsp; He lost himself utterly&mdash;he found his way
again.&nbsp; Room succeeded room.&nbsp; At last the lamp went
out, and he stumbled against some object which, when he stooped
for it, he found to be very cold and heavy to lift.&nbsp; The
sickly white light of dawn showed him the head of a statue.&nbsp;
Its marble hair was done in the bold lines of a helmet, on its
lips the chisel had left a faint smile, and it resembled Miss
Moorsom.&nbsp; While he was staring at it fixedly, the head began
to grow light in his fingers, to diminish and crumble to pieces,
and at last turned into a handful of dust, which was blown away
by a puff of wind so chilly that he woke up with a desperate
shiver and leaped headlong out of his bed-place.&nbsp; The day
had really come.&nbsp; He sat down by the cabin table, and taking
his head between his hands, did not stir for a very long
time.</p>
<p>Very quiet, he set himself to review this dream.&nbsp; The
lamp, of course, he connected with the search for a man.&nbsp;
But on closer examination he perceived that the reflection of
himself in the mirror was not really the true Renouard, but
somebody else whose face he could not remember.&nbsp; In the
deserted palace he recognised a sinister adaptation by his brain
of the long corridors with many doors, in the great building in
which his friend&rsquo;s newspaper was lodged on the first
floor.&nbsp; The marble head with Miss Moorsom&rsquo;s
face!&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; What other face could he have dreamed
of?&nbsp; And her complexion was fairer than Parian marble, than
the heads of angels.&nbsp; The wind at the end was the morning
breeze entering through the open porthole and touching his face
before the schooner could swing to the chilly gust.</p>
<p>Yes!&nbsp; And all this rational explanation of the fantastic
made it only more mysterious and weird.&nbsp; There was something
daemonic in that dream.&nbsp; It was one of those experiences
which throw a man out of conformity with the established order of
his kind and make him a creature of obscure suggestions.</p>
<p>Henceforth, without ever trying to resist, he went every
afternoon to the house where she lived.&nbsp; He went there as
passively as if in a dream.&nbsp; He could never make out how he
had attained the footing of intimacy in the Dunster mansion above
the bay&mdash;whether on the ground of personal merit or as the
pioneer of the vegetable silk industry.&nbsp; It must have been
the last, because he remembered distinctly, as distinctly as in a
dream, hearing old Dunster once telling him that his next public
task would be a careful survey of the Northern Districts to
discover tracts suitable for the cultivation of the silk
plant.&nbsp; The old man wagged his beard at him sagely.&nbsp; It
was indeed as absurd as a dream.</p>
<p>Willie of course would be there in the evening.&nbsp; But he
was more of a figure out of a nightmare, hovering about the
circle of chairs in his dress-clothes like a gigantic, repulsive,
and sentimental bat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do away with the beastly
cocoons all over the world,&rdquo; he buzzed in his blurred,
water-logged voice.&nbsp; He affected a great horror of insects
of all kinds.&nbsp; One evening he appeared with a red flower in
his button-hole.&nbsp; Nothing could have been more disgustingly
fantastic.&nbsp; And he would also say to Renouard: &ldquo;You
may yet change the history of our country.&nbsp; For economic
conditions do shape the history of nations.&nbsp; Eh?&nbsp;
What?&rdquo;&nbsp; And he would turn to Miss Moorsom for
approval, lowering protectingly his spatulous nose and looking up
with feeling from under his absurd eyebrows, which grew thin, in
the manner of canebrakes, out of his spongy skin.&nbsp; For this
large, bilious creature was an economist and a sentimentalist,
facile to tears, and a member of the Cobden Club.</p>
<p>In order to see as little of him as possible Renouard began
coming earlier so as to get away before his arrival, without
curtailing too much the hours of secret contemplation for which
he lived.&nbsp; He had given up trying to deceive himself.&nbsp;
His resignation was without bounds.&nbsp; He accepted the immense
misfortune of being in love with a woman who was in search of
another man only to throw herself into his arms.&nbsp; With such
desperate precision he defined in his thoughts the situation, the
consciousness of which traversed like a sharp arrow the sudden
silences of general conversation.&nbsp; The only thought before
which he quailed was the thought that this could not last; that
it must come to an end.&nbsp; He feared it instinctively as a
sick man may fear death.&nbsp; For it seemed to him that it must
be the death of him followed by a lightless, bottomless
pit.&nbsp; But his resignation was not spared the torments of
jealousy: the cruel, insensate, poignant, and imbecile jealousy,
when it seems that a woman betrays us simply by this that she
exists, that she breathes&mdash;and when the deep movements of
her nerves or her soul become a matter of distracting suspicion,
of killing doubt, of mortal anxiety.</p>
<p>In the peculiar condition of their sojourn Miss Moorsom went
out very little.&nbsp; She accepted this seclusion at the
Dunsters&rsquo; mansion as in a hermitage, and lived there,
watched over by a group of old people, with the lofty endurance
of a condescending and strong-headed goddess.&nbsp; It was
impossible to say if she suffered from anything in the world, and
whether this was the insensibility of a great passion
concentrated on itself, or a perfect restraint of manner, or the
indifference of superiority so complete as to be sufficient to
itself.&nbsp; But it was visible to Renouard that she took some
pleasure in talking to him at times.&nbsp; Was it because he was
the only person near her age?&nbsp; Was this, then, the secret of
his admission to the circle?</p>
<p>He admired her voice as well poised as her movements, as her
attitudes.&nbsp; He himself had always been a man of tranquil
tones.&nbsp; But the power of fascination had torn him out of his
very nature so completely that to preserve his habitual calmness
from going to pieces had become a terrible effort.</p>
<p>He used to go from her on board the schooner exhausted,
broken, shaken up, as though he had been put to the most
exquisite torture.&nbsp; When he saw her approaching he always
had a moment of hallucination.&nbsp; She was a misty and fair
creature, fitted for invisible music, for the shadows of love,
for the murmurs of waters.&nbsp; After a time (he could not be
always staring at the ground) he would summon up all his
resolution and look at her.&nbsp; There was a sparkle in the
clear obscurity of her eyes; and when she turned them on him they
seemed to give a new meaning to life.&nbsp; He would say to
himself that another man would have found long before the happy
release of madness, his wits burnt to cinders in that
radiance.&nbsp; But no such luck for him.&nbsp; His wits had come
unscathed through the furnaces of hot suns, of blazing deserts,
of flaming angers against the weaknesses of men and the obstinate
cruelties of hostile nature.</p>
<p>Being sane he had to be constantly on his guard against
falling into adoring silences or breaking out into wild
speeches.&nbsp; He had to keep watch on his eyes, his limbs, on
the muscles of his face.&nbsp; Their conversations were such as
they could be between these two people: she a young lady fresh
from the thick twilight of four million people and the
artificiality of several London seasons; he the man of definite
conquering tasks, the familiar of wide horizons, and in his very
repose holding aloof from these agglomerations of units in which
one loses one&rsquo;s importance even to oneself.&nbsp; They had
no common conversational small change.&nbsp; They had to use the
great pieces of general ideas, but they exchanged them
trivially.&nbsp; It was no serious commerce.&nbsp; Perhaps she
had not much of that coin.&nbsp; Nothing significant came from
her.&nbsp; It could not be said that she had received from the
contacts of the external world impressions of a personal kind,
different from other women.&nbsp; What was ravishing in her was
her quietness and, in her grave attitudes, the unfailing
brilliance of her femininity.&nbsp; He did not know what there
was under that ivory forehead so splendidly shaped, so gloriously
crowned.&nbsp; He could not tell what were her thoughts, her
feelings.&nbsp; Her replies were reflective, always preceded by a
short silence, while he hung on her lips anxiously.&nbsp; He felt
himself in the presence of a mysterious being in whom spoke an
unknown voice, like the voice of oracles, bringing everlasting
unrest to the heart.</p>
<p>He was thankful enough to sit in silence with secretly
clenched teeth, devoured by jealousy&mdash;and nobody could have
guessed that his quiet deferential bearing to all these
grey-heads was the supreme effort of stoicism, that the man was
engaged in keeping a sinister watch on his tortures lest his
strength should fail him.&nbsp; As before, when grappling with
other forces of nature, he could find in himself all sorts of
courage except the courage to run away.</p>
<p>It was perhaps from the lack of subjects they could have in
common that Miss Moorsom made him so often speak of his own
life.&nbsp; He did not shrink from talking about himself, for he
was free from that exacerbated, timid vanity which seals so many
vain-glorious lips.&nbsp; He talked to her in his restrained
voice, gazing at the tip of her shoe, and thinking that the time
was bound to come soon when her very inattention would get weary
of him.&nbsp; And indeed on stealing a glance he would see her
dazzling and perfect, her eyes vague, staring in mournful
immobility, with a drooping head that made him think of a tragic
Venus arising before him, not from the foam of the sea, but from
a distant, still more formless, mysterious, and potent immensity
of mankind.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p>One afternoon Renouard stepping out on the terrace found
nobody there.&nbsp; It was for him, at the same time, a
melancholy disappointment and a poignant relief.</p>
<p>The heat was great, the air was still, all the long windows of
the house stood wide open.&nbsp; At the further end, grouped
round a lady&rsquo;s work-table, several chairs disposed sociably
suggested invisible occupants, a company of conversing
shades.&nbsp; Renouard looked towards them with a sort of
dread.&nbsp; A most elusive, faint sound of ghostly talk issuing
from one of the rooms added to the illusion and stopped his
already hesitating footsteps.&nbsp; He leaned over the balustrade
of stone near a squat vase holding a tropical plant of a bizarre
shape.&nbsp; Professor Moorsom coming up from the garden with a
book under his arm and a white parasol held over his bare head,
found him there and, closing the parasol, leaned over by his side
with a remark on the increasing heat of the season.&nbsp;
Renouard assented and changed his position a little; the other,
after a short silence, administered unexpectedly a question
which, like the blow of a club on the head, deprived Renouard of
the power of speech and even thought, but, more cruel, left him
quivering with apprehension, not of death but of everlasting
torment.&nbsp; Yet the words were extremely simple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something will have to be done soon.&nbsp; We
can&rsquo;t remain in a state of suspended expectation for
ever.&nbsp; Tell me what do you think of our chances?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard, speechless, produced a faint smile.&nbsp; The
professor confessed in a jocular tone his impatience to complete
the circuit of the globe and be done with it.&nbsp; It was
impossible to remain quartered on the dear excellent Dunsters for
an indefinite time.&nbsp; And then there were the lectures he had
arranged to deliver in Paris.&nbsp; A serious matter.</p>
<p>That lectures by Professor Moorsom were a European event and
that brilliant audiences would gather to hear them Renouard did
not know.&nbsp; All he was aware of was the shock of this hint of
departure.&nbsp; The menace of separation fell on his head like a
thunderbolt.&nbsp; And he saw the absurdity of his emotion, for
hadn&rsquo;t he lived all these days under the very cloud?&nbsp;
The professor, his elbows spread out, looked down into the garden
and went on unburdening his mind.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; The department
of sentiment was directed by his daughter, and she had plenty of
volunteered moral support; but he had to look after the practical
side of life without assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the less hesitation in speaking to you about my
anxiety, because I feel you are friendly to us and at the same
time you are detached from all these sublimities&mdash;confound
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; murmured Renouard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that you are capable of calm judgment.&nbsp;
Here the atmosphere is simply detestable.&nbsp; Everybody has
knuckled under to sentiment.&nbsp; Perhaps your deliberate
opinion could influence . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want Miss Moorsom to give it up?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
professor turned to the young man dismally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven only knows what I want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard leaning his back against the balustrade folded his
arms on his breast, appeared to meditate profoundly.&nbsp; His
face, shaded softly by the broad brim of a planter&rsquo;s Panama
hat, with the straight line of the nose level with the forehead,
the eyes lost in the depth of the setting, and the chin well
forward, had such a profile as may be seen amongst the bronzes of
classical museums, pure under a crested helmet&mdash;recalled
vaguely a Minerva&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the most troublesome time I ever had in my
life,&rdquo; exclaimed the professor testily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely the man must be worth it,&rdquo; muttered
Renouard with a pang of jealousy traversing his breast like a
self-inflicted stab.</p>
<p>Whether enervated by the heat or giving way to pent up
irritation the professor surrendered himself to the mood of
sincerity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He began by being a pleasantly dull boy.&nbsp; He
developed into a pointlessly clever young man, without, I
suspect, ever trying to understand anything.&nbsp; My daughter
knew him from childhood.&nbsp; I am a busy man, and I confess
that their engagement was a complete surprise to me.&nbsp; I wish
their reasons for that step had been more na&iuml;ve.&nbsp; But
simplicity was out of fashion in their set.&nbsp; From a worldly
point of view he seems to have been a mere baby.&nbsp; Of course,
now, I am assured that he is the victim of his noble confidence
in the rectitude of his kind.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s mere
idealising of a sad reality.&nbsp; For my part I will tell you
that from the very beginning I had the gravest doubts of his
dishonesty.&nbsp; Unfortunately my clever daughter
hadn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And now we behold the reaction.&nbsp;
No.&nbsp; To be earnestly dishonest one must be really
poor.&nbsp; This was only a manifestation of his extremely
refined cleverness.&nbsp; The complicated simpleton.&nbsp; He had
an awful awakening though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In such words did Professor Moorsom give his &ldquo;young
friend&rdquo; to understand the state of his feelings toward the
lost man.&nbsp; It was evident that the father of Miss Moorsom
wished him to remain lost.&nbsp; Perhaps the unprecedented heat
of the season made him long for the cool spaces of the Pacific,
the sweep of the ocean&rsquo;s free wind along the promenade
decks, cumbered with long chairs, of a ship steaming towards the
Californian coast.&nbsp; To Renouard the philosopher appeared
simply the most treacherous of fathers.&nbsp; He was
amazed.&nbsp; But he was not at the end of his discoveries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be dead,&rdquo; the professor murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&nbsp; People don&rsquo;t die here sooner than in
Europe.&nbsp; If he had gone to hide in Italy, for instance, you
wouldn&rsquo;t think of saying that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&nbsp; And suppose he has become morally
disintegrated.&nbsp; You know he was not a strong
personality,&rdquo; the professor suggested moodily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My daughter&rsquo;s future is in question here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard thought that the love of such a woman was enough to
pull any broken man together&mdash;to drag a man out of his
grave.&nbsp; And he thought this with inward despair, which kept
him silent as much almost as his astonishment.&nbsp; At last he
managed to stammer out a generous&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let us even suppose. .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The professor struck in with a sadder accent than
before&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to be young.&nbsp; And then you have
been a man of action, and necessarily a believer in
success.&nbsp; But I have been looking too long at life not to
distrust its surprises.&nbsp; Age!&nbsp; Age!&nbsp; Here I stand
before you a man full of doubts and hesitation&mdash;<i>spe
lentus</i>, <i>timidus futuri</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a sign to Renouard not to interrupt, and in a lowered
voice, as if afraid of being overheard, even there, in the
solitude of the terrace&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the worst is that I am not even sure how far this
sentimental pilgrimage is genuine.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I doubt my
own child.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s true that she&rsquo;s a woman. . . .
&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard detected with horror a tone of resentment, as if the
professor had never forgiven his daughter for not dying instead
of his son.&nbsp; The latter noticed the young man&rsquo;s stony
stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you don&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; Yes, she&rsquo;s
clever, open-minded, popular, and&mdash;well, charming.&nbsp; But
you don&rsquo;t know what it is to have moved, breathed, existed,
and even triumphed in the mere smother and froth of
life&mdash;the brilliant froth.&nbsp; There thoughts, sentiments,
opinions, feelings, actions too, are nothing but agitation in
empty space&mdash;to amuse life&mdash;a sort of superior
debauchery, exciting and fatiguing, meaning nothing, leading
nowhere.&nbsp; She is the creature of that circle.&nbsp; And I
ask myself if she is obeying the uneasiness of an instinct
seeking its satisfaction, or is it a revulsion of feeling, or is
she merely deceiving her own heart by this dangerous trifling
with romantic images.&nbsp; And everything is
possible&mdash;except sincerity, such as only stark, struggling
humanity can know.&nbsp; No woman can stand that mode of life in
which women rule, and remain a perfectly genuine, simple human
being.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s some people coming
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moved off a pace, then turning his head: &ldquo;Upon my
word!&nbsp; I would be infinitely obliged to you if you could
throw a little cold water. . . &rdquo; and at a vaguely dismayed
gesture of Renouard, he added: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
afraid.&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t be putting out a sacred
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard could hardly find words for a protest: &ldquo;I
assure you that I never talk with Miss
Moorsom&mdash;on&mdash;on&mdash;that.&nbsp; And if you, her
father . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I envy you your innocence,&rdquo; sighed the
professor.&nbsp; &ldquo;A father is only an everyday
person.&nbsp; Flat.&nbsp; Stale.&nbsp; Moreover, my child would
naturally mistrust me.&nbsp; We belong to the same set.&nbsp;
Whereas you carry with you the prestige of the unknown.&nbsp; You
have proved yourself to be a force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the professor followed by Renouard joined the circle
of all the inmates of the house assembled at the other end of the
terrace about a tea-table; three white heads and that resplendent
vision of woman&rsquo;s glory, the sight of which had the power
to flutter his heart like a reminder of the mortality of his
frame.</p>
<p>He avoided the seat by the side of Miss Moorsom.&nbsp; The
others were talking together languidly.&nbsp; Unnoticed he looked
at that woman so marvellous that centuries seemed to lie between
them.&nbsp; He was oppressed and overcome at the thought of what
she could give to some man who really would be a force!&nbsp;
What a glorious struggle with this amazon.&nbsp; What noble
burden for the victorious strength.</p>
<p>Dear old Mrs. Dunster was dispensing tea, looking from time to
time with interest towards Miss Moorsom.&nbsp; The aged statesman
having eaten a raw tomato and drunk a glass of milk (a habit of
his early farming days, long before politics, when, pioneer of
wheat-growing, he demonstrated the possibility of raising crops
on ground looking barren enough to discourage a magician),
smoothed his white beard, and struck lightly Renouard&rsquo;s
knee with his big wrinkled hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better come back to-night and dine with us
quietly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He liked this young man, a pioneer, too, in more than one
direction.&nbsp; Mrs. Dunster added: &ldquo;Do.&nbsp; It will be
very quiet.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t even know if Willie will be home
for dinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; Renouard murmured his thanks, and left
the terrace to go on board the schooner.&nbsp; While lingering in
the drawing-room doorway he heard the resonant voice of old
Dunster uttering oracularly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . the leading man here some day. . . . Like
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard let the thin summer porti&egrave;re of the doorway
fall behind him.&nbsp; The voice of Professor Moorsom
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am told that he has made an enemy of almost every man
who had to work with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing.&nbsp; He did his work. . . . Like
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never counted the cost they say.&nbsp; Not even of
lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard understood that they were talking of him.&nbsp;
Before he could move away, Mrs. Dunster struck in
placidly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let yourself be shocked by the tales you
may hear of him, my dear.&nbsp; Most of it is envy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he heard Miss Moorsom&rsquo;s voice replying to the old
lady&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I am not easily deceived.&nbsp; I think I may
say I have an instinct for truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hastened away from that house with his heart full of
dread.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<p>On board the schooner, lying on the settee on his back with
the knuckles of his hands pressed over his eyes, he made up his
mind that he would not return to that house for dinner&mdash;that
he would never go back there any more.&nbsp; He made up his mind
some twenty times.&nbsp; The knowledge that he had only to go up
on the quarter deck, utter quietly the words: &ldquo;Man the
windlass,&rdquo; and that the schooner springing into life would
run a hundred miles out to sea before sunrise, deceived his
struggling will.&nbsp; Nothing easier!&nbsp; Yet, in the end,
this young man, almost ill-famed for his ruthless daring, the
inflexible leader of two tragically successful expeditions,
shrank from that act of savage energy, and began, instead, to
hunt for excuses.</p>
<p>No!&nbsp; It was not for him to run away like an incurable who
cuts his throat.&nbsp; He finished dressing and looked at his own
impassive face in the saloon mirror scornfully.&nbsp; While being
pulled on shore in the gig, he remembered suddenly the wild
beauty of a waterfall seen when hardly more than a boy, years
ago, in Menado.&nbsp; There was a legend of a governor-general of
the Dutch East Indies, on official tour, committing suicide on
that spot by leaping into the chasm.&nbsp; It was supposed that a
painful disease had made him weary of life.&nbsp; But was there
ever a visitation like his own, at the same time binding one to
life and so cruelly mortal!</p>
<p>The dinner was indeed quiet.&nbsp; Willie, given half an
hour&rsquo;s grace, failed to turn up, and his chair remained
vacant by the side of Miss Moorsom.&nbsp; Renouard had the
professor&rsquo;s sister on his left, dressed in an expensive
gown becoming her age.&nbsp; That maiden lady in her wonderful
preservation reminded Renouard somehow of a wax flower under
glass.&nbsp; There were no traces of the dust of life&rsquo;s
battles on her anywhere.&nbsp; She did not like him very much in
the afternoons, in his white drill suit and planter&rsquo;s hat,
which seemed to her an unduly Bohemian costume for calling in a
house where there were ladies.&nbsp; But in the evening, lithe
and elegant in his dress clothes and with his pleasant, slightly
veiled voice, he always made her conquest afresh.&nbsp; He might
have been anybody distinguished&mdash;the son of a duke.&nbsp;
Falling under that charm probably (and also because her brother
had given her a hint), she attempted to open her heart to
Renouard, who was watching with all the power of his soul her
niece across the table.&nbsp; She spoke to him as frankly as
though that miserable mortal envelope, emptied of everything but
hopeless passion, were indeed the son of a duke.</p>
<p>Inattentive, he heard her only in snatches, till the final
confidential burst: &ldquo;. . . glad if you would express an
opinion.&nbsp; Look at her, so charming, such a great favourite,
so generally admired!&nbsp; It would be too sad.&nbsp; We all
hoped she would make a brilliant marriage with somebody very rich
and of high position, have a house in London and in the country,
and entertain us all splendidly.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s so eminently
fitted for it.&nbsp; She has such hosts of distinguished
friends!&nbsp; And then&mdash;this instead! . . . My heart really
aches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her well-bred if anxious whisper was covered by the voice of
professor Moorsom discoursing subtly down the short length of the
dinner table on the Impermanency of the Measurable to his
venerable disciple.&nbsp; It might have been a chapter in a new
and popular book of Moorsomian philosophy.&nbsp; Patriarchal and
delighted, old Dunster leaned forward a little, his eyes shining
youthfully, two spots of colour at the roots of his white beard;
and Renouard, glancing at the senile excitement, recalled the
words heard on those subtle lips, adopted their scorn for his
own, saw their truth before this man ready to be amused by the
side of the grave.&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Intellectual debauchery in
the froth of existence!&nbsp; Froth and fraud!</p>
<p>On the same side of the table Miss Moorsom never once looked
towards her father, all her grace as if frozen, her red lips
compressed, the faintest rosiness under her dazzling complexion,
her black eyes burning motionless, and the very coppery gleams of
light lying still on the waves and undulation of her hair.&nbsp;
Renouard fancied himself overturning the table, smashing crystal
and china, treading fruit and flowers under foot, seizing her in
his arms, carrying her off in a tumult of shrieks from all these
people, a silent frightened mortal, into some profound retreat as
in the age of Cavern men.&nbsp; Suddenly everybody got up, and he
hastened to rise too, finding himself out of breath and quite
unsteady on his feet.</p>
<p>On the terrace the philosopher, after lighting a cigar,
slipped his hand condescendingly under his &ldquo;dear young
friend&rsquo;s&rdquo; arm.&nbsp; Renouard regarded him now with
the profoundest mistrust.&nbsp; But the great man seemed really
to have a liking for his young friend&mdash;one of those
mysterious sympathies, disregarding the differences of age and
position, which in this case might have been explained by the
failure of philosophy to meet a very real worry of a practical
kind.</p>
<p>After a turn or two and some casual talk the professor said
suddenly: &ldquo;My late son was in your school&mdash;do you
know?&nbsp; I can imagine that had he lived and you had ever met
you would have understood each other.&nbsp; He too was inclined
to action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sighed, then, shaking off the mournful thought and with a
nod at the dusky part of the terrace where the dress of his
daughter made a luminous stain: &ldquo;I really wish you would
drop in that quarter a few sensible, discouraging
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard disengaged himself from that most perfidious of men
under the pretence of astonishment, and stepping back a
pace&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you are making fun of me, Professor
Moorsom,&rdquo; he said with a low laugh, which was really a
sound of rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear young friend!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no subject for
jokes, to me. . . You don&rsquo;t seem to have any notion of your
prestige,&rdquo; he added, walking away towards the chairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humbug!&rdquo; thought Renouard, standing still and
looking after him.&nbsp; &ldquo;And yet!&nbsp; And yet!&nbsp;
What if it were true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He advanced then towards Miss Moorsom.&nbsp; Posed on the seat
on which they had first spoken to each other, it was her turn to
watch him coming on.&nbsp; But many of the windows were not
lighted that evening.&nbsp; It was dark over there.&nbsp; She
appeared to him luminous in her clear dress, a figure without
shape, a face without features, awaiting his approach, till he
got quite near to her, sat down, and they had exchanged a few
insignificant words.&nbsp; Gradually she came out like a magic
painting of charm, fascination, and desire, glowing mysteriously
on the dark background.&nbsp; Something imperceptible in the
lines of her attitude, in the modulations of her voice, seemed to
soften that suggestion of calm unconscious pride which enveloped
her always like a mantle.&nbsp; He, sensitive like a bond slave
to the moods of the master, was moved by the subtle relenting of
her grace to an infinite tenderness.&nbsp; He fought down the
impulse to seize her by the hand, lead her down into the garden
away under the big trees, and throw himself at her feet uttering
words of love.&nbsp; His emotion was so strong that he had to
cough slightly, and not knowing what to talk to her about he
began to tell her of his mother and sisters.&nbsp; All the family
were coming to London to live there, for some little time at
least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will go and tell them something of me.&nbsp;
Something seen,&rdquo; he said pressingly.</p>
<p>By this miserable subterfuge, like a man about to part with
his life, he hoped to make her remember him a little longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
glad to call when I get back.&nbsp; But that &lsquo;when&rsquo;
may be a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heard a light sigh.&nbsp; A cruel jealous curiosity made
him ask&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you growing weary, Miss Moorsom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A silence fell on his low spoken question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean heart-weary?&rdquo; sounded Miss
Moorsom&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me, I
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Never despair,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, Mr. Renouard, is a work of reparation.&nbsp; I
stand for truth here.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t think of
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could have taken her by the throat for every word seemed an
insult to his passion; but he only said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never doubted the&mdash;the&mdash;nobility of your
purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to hear the word weariness pronounced in this
connection surprises me.&nbsp; And from a man too who, I
understand, has never counted the cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are pleased to tease me,&rdquo; he said, directly
he had recovered his voice and had mastered his anger.&nbsp; It
was as if Professor Moorsom had dropped poison in his ear which
was spreading now and tainting his passion, his very
jealousy.&nbsp; He mistrusted every word that came from those
lips on which his life hung.&nbsp; &ldquo;How can you know
anything of men who do not count the cost?&rdquo; he asked in his
gentlest tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From hearsay&mdash;a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I assure you they are like the others, subject to
suffering, victims of spells. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of them, at least, speaks very
strangely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dismissed the subject after a short silence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. Renouard, I had a disappointment this morning.&nbsp;
This mail brought me a letter from the widow of the old
butler&mdash;you know.&nbsp; I expected to learn that she had
heard from&mdash;from here.&nbsp; But no.&nbsp; No letter arrived
home since we left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice was calm.&nbsp; His jealousy couldn&rsquo;t stand
much more of this sort of talk; but he was glad that nothing had
turned up to help the search; glad blindly,
unreasonably&mdash;only because it would keep her longer in his
sight&mdash;since she wouldn&rsquo;t give up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am too near her,&rdquo; he thought, moving a little
further on the seat.&nbsp; He was afraid in the revulsion of
feeling of flinging himself on her hands, which were lying on her
lap, and covering them with kisses.&nbsp; He was afraid.&nbsp;
Nothing, nothing could shake that spell&mdash;not if she were
ever so false, stupid, or degraded.&nbsp; She was fate
itself.&nbsp; The extent of his misfortune plunged him in such a
stupor that he failed at first to hear the sound of voices and
footsteps inside the drawing-room.&nbsp; Willie had come
home&mdash;and the Editor was with him.</p>
<p>They burst out on the terrace babbling noisily, and then
pulling themselves together stood still, surprising&mdash;and as
if themselves surprised.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>
<p>They had been feasting a poet from the bush, the latest
discovery of the Editor.&nbsp; Such discoveries were the
business, the vocation, the pride and delight of the only apostle
of letters in the hemisphere, the solitary patron of culture, the
Slave of the Lamp&mdash;as he subscribed himself at the bottom of
the weekly literary page of his paper.&nbsp; He had had no
difficulty in persuading the virtuous Willie (who had festive
instincts) to help in the good work, and now they had left the
poet lying asleep on the hearthrug of the editorial room and had
rushed to the Dunster mansion wildly.&nbsp; The Editor had
another discovery to announce.&nbsp; Swaying a little where he
stood he opened his mouth very wide to shout the one word
&ldquo;Found!&rdquo;&nbsp; Behind him Willie flung both his hands
above his head and let them fall dramatically.&nbsp; Renouard saw
the four white-headed people at the end of the terrace rise all
together from their chairs with an effect of sudden panic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you&mdash;he&mdash;is&mdash;found,&rdquo; the
patron of letters shouted emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this!&rdquo; exclaimed Renouard in a choked
voice.&nbsp; Miss Moorsom seized his wrist suddenly, and at that
contact fire ran through all his veins, a hot stillness descended
upon him in which he heard the blood&mdash;or the
fire&mdash;beating in his ears.&nbsp; He made a movement as if to
rise, but was restrained by the convulsive pressure on his
wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Moorsom&rsquo;s eyes stared
black as night, searching the space before her.&nbsp; Far away
the Editor strutted forward, Willie following with his
ostentatious manner of carrying his bulky and oppressive carcass
which, however, did not remain exactly perpendicular for two
seconds together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The innocent Arthur . . . Yes.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got
him,&rdquo; the Editor became very business-like.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, this letter has done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He plunged into an inside pocket for it, slapped the scrap of
paper with his open palm.&nbsp; &ldquo;From that old woman.&nbsp;
William had it in his pocket since this morning when Miss Moorsom
gave it to him to show me.&nbsp; Forgot all about it till an hour
ago.&nbsp; Thought it was of no importance.&nbsp; Well, no!&nbsp;
Not till it was properly read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard and Miss Moorsom emerged from the shadows side by
side, a well-matched couple, animated yet statuesque in their
calmness and in their pallor.&nbsp; She had let go his
wrist.&nbsp; On catching sight of Renouard the Editor
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;you here!&rdquo; in a quite shrill
voice.</p>
<p>There came a dead pause.&nbsp; All the faces had in them
something dismayed and cruel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the very man we want,&rdquo; continued the
Editor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Excuse my excitement.&nbsp; You are the very
man, Renouard.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you tell me that your assistant
called himself Walter?&nbsp; Yes?&nbsp; Thought so.&nbsp; But
here&rsquo;s that old woman&mdash;the butler&rsquo;s
wife&mdash;listen to this.&nbsp; She writes: All I can tell you,
Miss, is that my poor husband directed his letters to the name of
H. Walter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard&rsquo;s violent but repressed exclamation was lost in
a general murmur and shuffle of feet.&nbsp; The Editor made a
step forward, bowed with creditable steadiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Moorsom, allow me to congratulate you from the
bottom of my heart on the happy&mdash;er&mdash;issue. . .
&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; muttered Renouard irresolutely.</p>
<p>The Editor jumped on him in the manner of their old
friendship.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, you!&nbsp; You are a fine fellow
too.&nbsp; With your solitary ways of life you will end by having
no more discrimination than a savage.&nbsp; Fancy living with a
gentleman for months and never guessing.&nbsp; A man, I am
certain, accomplished, remarkable, out of the common, since he
had been distinguished&rdquo; (he bowed again) &ldquo;by Miss
Moorsom, whom we all admire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned her back on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope to goodness you haven&rsquo;t been leading him a
dog&rsquo;s life, Geoffrey,&rdquo; the Editor addressed his
friend in a whispered aside.</p>
<p>Renouard seized a chair violently, sat down, and propping his
elbow on his knee leaned his head on his hand.&nbsp; Behind him
the sister of the professor looked up to heaven and wrung her
hands stealthily.&nbsp; Mrs. Dunster&rsquo;s hands were clasped
forcibly under her chin, but she, dear soul, was looking
sorrowfully at Willie.&nbsp; The model nephew!&nbsp; In this
strange state!&nbsp; So very much flushed!&nbsp; The careful
disposition of the thin hairs across Willie&rsquo;s bald spot was
deplorably disarranged, and the spot itself was red and, as it
were, steaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Geoffrey?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Editor seemed disconcerted by the silent attitudes round him, as
though he had expected all these people to shout and dance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have him on the island&mdash;haven&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes: I have him there,&rdquo; said Renouard,
without looking up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then!&rdquo;&nbsp; The Editor looked helplessly
around as if begging for response of some sort.&nbsp; But the
only response that came was very unexpected.&nbsp; Annoyed at
being left in the background, and also because very little drink
made him nasty, the emotional Willie turned malignant all at
once, and in a bibulous tone surprising in a man able to keep his
balance so well&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&nbsp; But you haven&rsquo;t got him here&mdash;not
yet!&rdquo; he sneered.&nbsp; &ldquo;No!&nbsp; You haven&rsquo;t
got him yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This outrageous exhibition was to the Editor like the lash to
a jaded horse.&nbsp; He positively jumped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of that?&nbsp; What do you mean?&nbsp;
We&mdash;haven&rsquo;t&mdash;got&mdash;him&mdash;here.&nbsp; Of
course he isn&rsquo;t here!&nbsp; But Geoffrey&rsquo;s schooner
is here.&nbsp; She can be sent at once to fetch him here.&nbsp;
No!&nbsp; Stay!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a better plan.&nbsp; Why
shouldn&rsquo;t you all sail over to Malata, professor?&nbsp;
Save time!&nbsp; I am sure Miss Moorsom would prefer. .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a gallant flourish of his arm he looked for Miss
Moorsom.&nbsp; She had disappeared.&nbsp; He was taken aback
somewhat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; H&rsquo;m.&nbsp; Yes. . . . Why not.&nbsp; A
pleasure cruise, delightful ship, delightful season, delightful
errand, del . . . No!&nbsp; There are no objections.&nbsp;
Geoffrey, I understand, has indulged in a bungalow three sizes
too large for him.&nbsp; He can put you all up.&nbsp; It will be
a pleasure for him.&nbsp; It will be the greatest
privilege.&nbsp; Any man would be proud of being an agent of this
happy reunion.&nbsp; I am proud of the little part I&rsquo;ve
played.&nbsp; He will consider it the greatest honour.&nbsp;
Geoff, my boy, you had better be stirring to-morrow bright and
early about the preparations for the trip.&nbsp; It would be
criminal to lose a single day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was as flushed as Willie, the excitement keeping up the
effect of the festive dinner.&nbsp; For a time Renouard, silent,
as if he had not heard a word of all that babble, did not
stir.&nbsp; But when he got up it was to advance towards the
Editor and give him such a hearty slap on the back that the plump
little man reeled in his tracks and looked quite frightened for a
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a heaven-born discoverer and a first-rate
manager. . . He&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the only
way.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t resist the claim of sentiment, and you
must even risk the voyage to Malata. . . &rdquo; Renouard&rsquo;s
voice sank.&nbsp; &ldquo;A lonely spot,&rdquo; he added, and fell
into thought under all these eyes converging on him in the sudden
silence.&nbsp; His slow glance passed over all the faces in
succession, remaining arrested on Professor Moorsom, stony eyed,
a smouldering cigar in his fingers, and with his sister standing
by his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be infinitely gratified if you consent to
come.&nbsp; But, of course, you will.&nbsp; We shall sail
to-morrow evening then.&nbsp; And now let me leave you to your
happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed, very grave, pointed suddenly his finger at Willie
who was swaying about with a sleepy frown. . . . &ldquo;Look at
him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s overcome with happiness.&nbsp; You had
better put him to bed . . . &rdquo; and disappeared while every
head on the terrace was turned to Willie with varied
expressions.</p>
<p>Renouard ran through the house.&nbsp; Avoiding the carriage
road he fled down the steep short cut to the shore, where his gig
was waiting.&nbsp; At his loud shout the sleeping Kanakas jumped
up.&nbsp; He leaped in.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shove off.&nbsp; Give
way!&rdquo; and the gig darted through the water.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Give way!&nbsp; Give way!&rdquo;&nbsp; She flew past the
wool-clippers sleeping at their anchors each with the open
unwinking eye of the lamp in the rigging; she flew past the
flagship of the Pacific squadron, a great mass all dark and
silent, heavy with the slumbers of five hundred men, and where
the invisible sentries heard his urgent &ldquo;Give way!&nbsp;
Give way!&rdquo; in the night.&nbsp; The Kanakas, panting, rose
off the thwarts at every stroke.&nbsp; Nothing could be fast
enough for him!&nbsp; And he ran up the side of his schooner
shaking the ladder noisily with his rush.</p>
<p>On deck he stumbled and stood still.</p>
<p>Wherefore this haste?&nbsp; To what end, since he knew well
before he started that he had a pursuer from whom there was no
escape.</p>
<p>As his foot touched the deck his will, his purpose he had been
hurrying to save, died out within.&nbsp; It had been nothing less
than getting the schooner under-way, letting her vanish silently
in the night from amongst these sleeping ships.&nbsp; And now he
was certain he could not do it.&nbsp; It was impossible!&nbsp;
And he reflected that whether he lived or died such an act would
lay him under a dark suspicion from which he shrank.&nbsp; No,
there was nothing to be done.</p>
<p>He went down into the cabin and, before even unbuttoning his
overcoat, took out of the drawer the letter addressed to his
assistant; that letter which he had found in the pigeon-hole
labelled &ldquo;Malata&rdquo; in young Dunster&rsquo;s outer
office, where it had been waiting for three months some occasion
for being forwarded.&nbsp; From the moment of dropping it in the
drawer he had utterly forgotten its existence&mdash;till now,
when the man&rsquo;s name had come out so clamorously.&nbsp; He
glanced at the common envelope, noted the shaky and laborious
handwriting: H. Walter, Esqre.&nbsp; Undoubtedly the very last
letter the old butler had posted before his illness, and in
answer clearly to one from &ldquo;Master Arthur&rdquo;
instructing him to address in the future: &ldquo;Care of Messrs.
W. Dunster and Co.&rdquo;&nbsp; Renouard made as if to open the
envelope, but paused, and, instead, tore the letter deliberately
in two, in four, in eight.&nbsp; With his hand full of pieces of
paper he returned on deck and scattered them overboard on the
dark water, in which they vanished instantly.</p>
<p>He did it slowly, without hesitation or remorse.&nbsp; H.
Walter, Esqre, in Malata.&nbsp; The innocent Arthur&mdash;What
was his name?&nbsp; The man sought for by that woman who as she
went by seemed to draw all the passion of the earth to her,
without effort, not deigning to notice, naturally, as other women
breathed the air.&nbsp; But Renouard was no longer jealous of her
very existence.&nbsp; Whatever its meaning it was not for that
man he had picked up casually on obscure impulse, to get rid of
the tiresome expostulations of a so-called friend; a man of whom
he really knew nothing&mdash;and now a dead man.&nbsp; In
Malata.&nbsp; Oh, yes!&nbsp; He was there secure enough,
untroubled in his grave.&nbsp; In Malata.&nbsp; To bury him was
the last service Renouard had rendered to his assistant before
leaving the island on this trip to town.</p>
<p>Like many men ready enough for arduous enterprises Renouard
was inclined to evade the small complications of existence.&nbsp;
This trait of his character was composed of a little indolence,
some disdain, and a shrinking from contests with certain forms of
vulgarity&mdash;like a man who would face a lion and go out of
his way to avoid a toad.&nbsp; His intercourse with the
meddlesome journalist was that merely outward intimacy without
sympathy some young men get drawn into easily.&nbsp; It had
amused him rather to keep that &ldquo;friend&rdquo; in the dark
about the fate of his assistant.&nbsp; Renouard had never needed
other company than his own, for there was in him something of the
sensitiveness of a dreamer who is easily jarred.&nbsp; He had
said to himself that the all-knowing one would only preach again
about the evils of solitude and worry his head off in favour of
some forlornly useless prot&eacute;g&eacute; of his.&nbsp; Also
the inquisitiveness of the Editor had irritated him and had
closed his lips in sheer disgust.</p>
<p>And now he contemplated the noose of consequences drawing
tight around him.</p>
<p>It was the memory of that diplomatic reticence which on the
terrace had stiffled his first cry which would have told them all
that the man sought for was not to be met on earth any
more.&nbsp; He shrank from the absurdity of hearing the
all-knowing one, and not very sober at that, turning on him with
righteous reproaches&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never told me.&nbsp; You gave me to understand that
your assistant was alive, and now you say he&rsquo;s dead.&nbsp;
Which is it?&nbsp; Were you lying then or are you lying
now?&rdquo;&nbsp; No! the thought of such a scene was not to be
borne.&nbsp; He had sat down appalled, thinking: &ldquo;What
shall I do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His courage had oozed out of him.&nbsp; Speaking the truth
meant the Moorsoms going away at once&mdash;while it seemed to
him that he would give the last shred of his rectitude to secure
a day more of her company.&nbsp; He sat on&mdash;silent.&nbsp;
Slowly, from confused sensations, from his talk with the
professor, the manner of the girl herself, the intoxicating
familiarity of her sudden hand-clasp, there had come to him a
half glimmer of hope.&nbsp; The other man was dead.&nbsp; Then! .
. . Madness, of course&mdash;but he could not give it up.&nbsp;
He had listened to that confounded busybody arranging
everything&mdash;while all these people stood around assenting,
under the spell of that dead romance.&nbsp; He had listened
scornful and silent.&nbsp; The glimmers of hope, of opportunity,
passed before his eyes.&nbsp; He had only to sit still and say
nothing.&nbsp; That and no more.&nbsp; And what was truth to him
in the face of that great passion which had flung him prostrate
in spirit at her adored feet!</p>
<p>And now it was done!&nbsp; Fatality had willed it!&nbsp; With
the eyes of a mortal struck by the maddening thunderbolt of the
gods, Renouard looked up to the sky, an immense black pall dusted
over with gold, on which great shudders seemed to pass from the
breath of life affirming its sway.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
<p>At last, one morning, in a clear spot of a glassy horizon
charged with heraldic masses of black vapours, the island grew
out from the sea, showing here and there its naked members of
basaltic rock through the rents of heavy foliage.&nbsp; Later, in
the great spilling of all the riches of sunset, Malata stood out
green and rosy before turning into a violet shadow in the
autumnal light of the expiring day.&nbsp; Then came the
night.&nbsp; In the faint airs the schooner crept on past a
sturdy squat headland, and it was pitch dark when her headsails
ran down, she turned short on her heel, and her anchor bit into
the sandy bottom on the edge of the outer reef; for it was too
dangerous then to attempt entering the little bay full of
shoals.&nbsp; After the last solemn flutter of the mainsail the
murmuring voices of the Moorsom party lingered, very frail, in
the black stillness.</p>
<p>They were sitting aft, on chairs, and nobody made a
move.&nbsp; Early in the day, when it had become evident that the
wind was failing, Renouard, basing his advice on the shortcomings
of his bachelor establishment, had urged on the ladies the
advisability of not going ashore in the middle of the
night.&nbsp; Now he approached them in a constrained manner (it
was astonishing the constraint that had reigned between him and
his guests all through the passage) and renewed his
arguments.&nbsp; No one ashore would dream of his bringing any
visitors with him.&nbsp; Nobody would even think of coming
off.&nbsp; There was only one old canoe on the plantation.&nbsp;
And landing in the schooner&rsquo;s boats would be awkward in the
dark.&nbsp; There was the risk of getting aground on some shallow
patches.&nbsp; It would be best to spend the rest of the night on
board.</p>
<p>There was really no opposition.&nbsp; The professor smoking a
pipe, and very comfortable in an ulster buttoned over his
tropical clothes, was the first to speak from his long chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most excellent advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next to him Miss Moorsom assented by a long silence.&nbsp;
Then in a voice as of one coming out of a dream&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so this is Malata,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have often wondered . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shiver passed through Renouard.&nbsp; She had
wondered!&nbsp; What about?&nbsp; Malata was himself.&nbsp; He
and Malata were one.&nbsp; And she had wondered!&nbsp; She had .
. .</p>
<p>The professor&rsquo;s sister leaned over towards
Renouard.&nbsp; Through all these days at sea the
man&rsquo;s&mdash;the found man&rsquo;s&mdash;existence had not
been alluded to on board the schooner.&nbsp; That reticence was
part of the general constraint lying upon them all.&nbsp; She,
herself, certainly had not been exactly elated by this
finding&mdash;poor Arthur, without money, without
prospects.&nbsp; But she felt moved by the sentiment and romance
of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful,&rdquo; she whispered out of
her white wrap, &ldquo;to think of poor Arthur sleeping there, so
near to our dear lovely Felicia, and not knowing the immense joy
in store for him to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was such artificiality in the wax-flower lady that
nothing in this speech touched Renouard.&nbsp; It was but the
simple anxiety of his heart that he was voicing when he muttered
gloomily&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one in the world knows what to-morrow may hold in
store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mature lady had a recoil as though he had said something
impolite.&nbsp; What a harsh thing to say&mdash;instead of
finding something nice and appropriate.&nbsp; On board, where she
never saw him in evening clothes, Renouard&rsquo;s resemblance to
a duke&rsquo;s son was not so apparent to her.&nbsp; Nothing but
his&mdash;ah&mdash;bohemianism remained.&nbsp; She rose with a
sort of ostentation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s late&mdash;and since we are going to sleep
on board to-night . . .&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it does
seem so cruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The professor started up eagerly, knocking the ashes out of
his pipe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Infinitely more sensible, my dear
Emma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard waited behind Miss Moorsom&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<p>She got up slowly, moved one step forward, and paused looking
at the shore.&nbsp; The blackness of the island blotted out the
stars with its vague mass like a low thundercloud brooding over
the waters and ready to burst into flame and crashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so&mdash;this is Malata,&rdquo; she repeated
dreamily, moving towards the cabin door.&nbsp; The clear cloak
hanging from her shoulders, the ivory face&mdash;for the night
had put out nothing of her but the gleams of her hair&mdash;made
her resemble a shining dream-woman uttering words of wistful
inquiry.&nbsp; She disappeared without a sign, leaving Renouard
penetrated to the very marrow by the sounds that came from her
body like a mysterious resonance of an exquisite instrument.</p>
<p>He stood stock still.&nbsp; What was this accidental touch
which had evoked the strange accent of her voice?&nbsp; He dared
not answer that question.&nbsp; But he had to answer the question
of what was to be done now.&nbsp; Had the moment of confession
come?&nbsp; The thought was enough to make one&rsquo;s blood run
cold.</p>
<p>It was as if those people had a premonition of
something.&nbsp; In the taciturn days of the passage he had
noticed their reserve even amongst themselves.&nbsp; The
professor smoked his pipe moodily in retired spots.&nbsp;
Renouard had caught Miss Moorsom&rsquo;s eyes resting on himself
more than once, with a peculiar and grave expression.&nbsp; He
fancied that she avoided all opportunities of conversation.&nbsp;
The maiden lady seemed to nurse a grievance.&nbsp; And now what
had he to do?</p>
<p>The lights on the deck had gone out one after the other.&nbsp;
The schooner slept.</p>
<p>About an hour after Miss Moorsom had gone below without a sign
or a word for him, Renouard got out of his hammock slung in the
waist under the midship awning&mdash;for he had given up all the
accommodation below to his guests.&nbsp; He got out with a sudden
swift movement, flung off his sleeping jacket, rolled his pyjamas
up his thighs, and stole forward, unseen by the one Kanaka of the
anchor-watch.&nbsp; His white torso, naked like a stripped
athlete&rsquo;s, glimmered, ghostly, in the deep shadows of the
deck.&nbsp; Unnoticed he got out of the ship over the
knight-heads, ran along the back rope, and seizing the
dolphin-striker firmly with both hands, lowered himself into the
sea without a splash.</p>
<p>He swam away, noiseless like a fish, and then struck boldly
for the land, sustained, embraced, by the tepid water.&nbsp; The
gentle, voluptuous heave of its breast swung him up and down
slightly; sometimes a wavelet murmured in his ears; from time to
time, lowering his feet, he felt for the bottom on a shallow
patch to rest and correct his direction.&nbsp; He landed at the
lower end of the bungalow garden, into the dead stillness of the
island.&nbsp; There were no lights.&nbsp; The plantation seemed
to sleep, as profoundly as the schooner.&nbsp; On the path a
small shell cracked under his naked heel.</p>
<p>The faithful half-caste foreman going his rounds cocked his
ears at the sharp sound.&nbsp; He gave one enormous start of fear
at the sight of the swift white figure flying at him out of the
night.&nbsp; He crouched in terror, and then sprang up and
clicked his tongue in amazed recognition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tse!&nbsp; Tse!&nbsp; The master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Luiz, and listen to what I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, it was the master, the strong master who was never known
to raise his voice, the man blindly obeyed and never
questioned.&nbsp; He talked low and rapidly in the quiet night,
as if every minute were precious.&nbsp; On learning that three
guests were coming to stay Luiz clicked his tongue rapidly.&nbsp;
These clicks were the uniform, stenographic symbols of his
emotions, and he could give them an infinite variety of
meaning.&nbsp; He listened to the rest in a deep silence hardly
affected by the low, &ldquo;Yes, master,&rdquo; whenever Renouard
paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand?&rdquo; the latter insisted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No preparations are to be made till we land in the
morning.&nbsp; And you are to say that Mr. Walter has gone off in
a trading schooner on a round of the islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No mistakes&mdash;mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard walked back towards the sea.&nbsp; Luiz, following
him, proposed to call out half a dozen boys and man the
canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imbecile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tse!&nbsp; Tse!&nbsp; Tse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand that you haven&rsquo;t seen
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, master.&nbsp; But what a long swim.&nbsp; Suppose
you drown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you can say of me and of Mr. Walter what you
like.&nbsp; The dead don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard entered the sea and heard a faint &ldquo;Tse! Tse!
Tse!&rdquo; of concern from the half-caste, who had already lost
sight of the master&rsquo;s dark head on the overshadowed
water.</p>
<p>Renouard set his direction by a big star that, dipping on the
horizon, seemed to look curiously into his face.&nbsp; On this
swim back he felt the mournful fatigue of all that length of the
traversed road, which brought him no nearer to his desire.&nbsp;
It was as if his love had sapped the invisible supports of his
strength.&nbsp; There came a moment when it seemed to him that he
must have swum beyond the confines of life.&nbsp; He had a
sensation of eternity close at hand, demanding no
effort&mdash;offering its peace.&nbsp; It was easy to swim like
this beyond the confines of life looking at a star.&nbsp; But the
thought: &ldquo;They will think I dared not face them and
committed suicide,&rdquo; caused a revolt of his mind which
carried him on.&nbsp; He returned on board, as he had left,
unheard and unseen.&nbsp; He lay in his hammock utterly exhausted
and with a confused feeling that he had been beyond the confines
of life, somewhere near a star, and that it was very quiet
there.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>
<p>Sheltered by the squat headland from the first morning sparkle
of the sea the little bay breathed a delicious freshness.&nbsp;
The party from the schooner landed at the bottom of the
garden.&nbsp; They exchanged insignificant words in studiously
casual tones.&nbsp; The professor&rsquo;s sister put up a
long-handled eye-glass as if to scan the novel surroundings, but
in reality searching for poor Arthur anxiously.&nbsp; Having
never seen him otherwise than in his town clothes she had no idea
what he would look like.&nbsp; It had been left to the professor
to help his ladies out of the boat because Renouard, as if intent
on giving directions, had stepped forward at once to meet the
half-caste Luiz hurrying down the path.&nbsp; In the distance, in
front of the dazzlingly sunlit bungalow, a row of dark-faced
house-boys unequal in stature and varied in complexion preserved
the immobility of a guard of honour.</p>
<p>Luiz had taken off his soft felt hat before coming within
earshot.&nbsp; Renouard bent his head to his rapid talk of
domestic arrangements he meant to make for the visitors; another
bed in the master&rsquo;s room for the ladies and a cot for the
gentleman to be hung in the room opposite where&mdash;where Mr.
Walter&mdash;here he gave a scared look all round&mdash;Mr.
Walter&mdash;had died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; assented Renouard in an even
undertone.&nbsp; &ldquo;And remember what you have to say of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, master.&nbsp; Only&rdquo;&mdash;he wriggled
slightly and put one bare foot on the other for a moment in
apologetic embarrassment&mdash;&ldquo;only
I&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t like to say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard looked at him without anger, without any sort of
expression.&nbsp; &ldquo;Frightened of the dead?&nbsp; Eh?&nbsp;
Well&mdash;all right.&nbsp; I will say it myself&mdash;I suppose
once for all. . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; Immediately he raised his voice
very much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send the boys down to bring up the luggage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard turned to his distinguished guests who, like a
personally conducted party of tourists, had stopped and were
looking about them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he began with an impassive
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;My man has just told me that Mr. Walter . .
.&rdquo; he managed to smile, but didn&rsquo;t correct himself .
. . &ldquo;has gone in a trading schooner on a short tour of the
islands, to the westward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This communication was received in profound silence.</p>
<p>Renouard forgot himself in the thought: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
done!&rdquo;&nbsp; But the sight of the string of boys marching
up to the house with suit-cases and dressing-bags rescued him
from that appalling abstraction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I can do is to beg you to make yourselves at home .
. . with what patience you may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was so obviously the only thing to do that everybody
moved on at once.&nbsp; The professor walked alongside Renouard,
behind the two ladies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather unexpected&mdash;this absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; muttered Renouard.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
trip has to be made every year to engage labour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see . . . And he . . . How vexingly elusive the poor
fellow has become!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll begin to think that some
wicked fairy is favouring this love tale with unpleasant
attentions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard noticed that the party did not seem weighed down by
this new disappointment.&nbsp; On the contrary they moved with a
freer step.&nbsp; The professor&rsquo;s sister dropped her
eye-glass to the end of its chain.&nbsp; Miss Moorsom took the
lead.&nbsp; The professor, his lips unsealed, lingered in the
open: but Renouard did not listen to that man&rsquo;s talk.&nbsp;
He looked after that man&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;if indeed that
creature of irresistible seductions were a daughter of
mortals.&nbsp; The very intensity of his desire, as if his soul
were streaming after her through his eyes, defeated his object of
keeping hold of her as long as possible with, at least, one of
his senses.&nbsp; Her moving outlines dissolved into a misty
coloured shimmer of a woman made of flame and shadows, crossing
the threshold of his house.</p>
<p>The days which followed were not exactly such as Renouard had
feared&mdash;yet they were not better than his fears.&nbsp; They
were accursed in all the moods they brought him.&nbsp; But the
general aspect of things was quiet.&nbsp; The professor smoked
innumerable pipes with the air of a worker on his holiday, always
in movement and looking at things with that mysteriously
sagacious aspect of men who are admittedly wiser than the rest of
the world.&nbsp; His white head of hair&mdash;whiter than
anything within the horizon except the broken water on the
reefs&mdash;was glimpsed in every part of the plantation always
on the move under the white parasol.&nbsp; And once he climbed
the headland and appeared suddenly to those below, a white speck
elevated in the blue, with a diminutive but statuesque
effect.</p>
<p>Felicia Moorsom remained near the house.&nbsp; Sometimes she
could be seen with a despairing expression scribbling rapidly in
her lock-up dairy.&nbsp; But only for a moment.&nbsp; At the
sound of Renouard&rsquo;s footsteps she would turn towards him
her beautiful face, adorable in that calm which was like a
wilful, like a cruel ignoring of her tremendous power.&nbsp;
Whenever she sat on the verandah, on a chair more specially
reserved for her use, Renouard would stroll up and sit on the
steps near her, mostly silent, and often not trusting himself to
turn his glance on her.&nbsp; She, very still with her eyes
half-closed, looked down on his head&mdash;so that to a beholder
(such as Professor Moorsom, for instance) she would appear to be
turning over in her mind profound thoughts about that man sitting
at her feet, his shoulders bowed a little, his hands
listless&mdash;as if vanquished.&nbsp; And, indeed, the moral
poison of falsehood has such a decomposing power that Renouard
felt his old personality turn to dead dust.&nbsp; Often, in the
evening, when they sat outside conversing languidly in the dark,
he felt that he must rest his forehead on her feet and burst into
tears.</p>
<p>The professor&rsquo;s sister suffered from some little strain
caused by the unstability of her own feelings toward
Renouard.&nbsp; She could not tell whether she really did dislike
him or not.&nbsp; At times he appeared to her most fascinating;
and, though he generally ended by saying something shockingly
crude, she could not resist her inclination to talk with
him&mdash;at least not always.&nbsp; One day when her niece had
left them alone on the verandah she leaned forward in her
chair&mdash;speckless, resplendent, and, in her way, almost as
striking a personality as her niece, who did not resemble her in
the least.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear Felicia has inherited her hair and
the greatest part of her appearance from her mother,&rdquo; the
maiden lady used to tell people.</p>
<p>She leaned forward then, confidentially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; Mr. Renouard!&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t you
something comforting to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up, as surprised as if a voice from heaven had
spoken with this perfect society intonation, and by the puzzled
profundity of his blue eyes fluttered the wax-flower of refined
womanhood.&nbsp; She continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;For&mdash;I can
speak to you openly on this tiresome subject&mdash;only think
what a terrible strain this hope deferred must be for
Felicia&rsquo;s heart&mdash;for her nerves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why speak to me about it,&rdquo; he muttered feeling
half choked suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&nbsp; As a friend&mdash;a well-wisher&mdash;the
kindest of hosts.&nbsp; I am afraid we are really eating you out
of house and home.&rdquo;&nbsp; She laughed a little.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; When, when will this suspense be relieved!&nbsp;
That poor lost Arthur!&nbsp; I confess that I am almost afraid of
the great moment.&nbsp; It will be like seeing a
ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen a ghost?&rdquo; asked Renouard, in a
dull voice.</p>
<p>She shifted her hands a little.&nbsp; Her pose was perfect in
its ease and middle-aged grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not actually.&nbsp; Only in a photograph.&nbsp; But we
have many friends who had the experience of
apparitions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; They see ghosts in London,&rdquo; mumbled
Renouard, not looking at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frequently&mdash;in a certain very interesting
set.&nbsp; But all sorts of people do.&nbsp; We have a friend, a
very famous author&mdash;his ghost is a girl.&nbsp; One of my
brother&rsquo;s intimates is a very great man of science.&nbsp;
He is friendly with a ghost . . . Of a girl too,&rdquo; she added
in a voice as if struck for the first time by the
coincidence.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the photograph of that apparition
which I have seen.&nbsp; Very sweet.&nbsp; Most
interesting.&nbsp; A little cloudy naturally. . . . Mr.
Renouard!&nbsp; I hope you are not a sceptic.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s so
consoling to think. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those plantation boys of mine see ghosts too,&rdquo;
said Renouard grimly.</p>
<p>The sister of the philosopher sat up stiffly.&nbsp; What
crudeness!&nbsp; It was always so with this strange young
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Renouard!&nbsp; How can you compare the
superstitious fancies of your horrible savages with the
manifestations . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>Words failed her.&nbsp; She broke off with a very faint primly
angry smile.&nbsp; She was perhaps the more offended with him
because of that flutter at the beginning of the
conversation.&nbsp; And in a moment with perfect tact and dignity
she got up from her chair and left him alone.</p>
<p>Renouard didn&rsquo;t even look up.&nbsp; It was not the
displeasure of the lady which deprived him of his sleep that
night.&nbsp; He was beginning to forget what simple, honest sleep
was like.&nbsp; His hammock from the ship had been hung for him
on a side verandah, and he spent his nights in it on his back,
his hands folded on his chest, in a sort of half conscious,
oppressed stupor.&nbsp; In the morning he watched with unseeing
eyes the headland come out a shapeless inkblot against the thin
light of the false dawn, pass through all the stages of daybreak
to the deep purple of its outlined mass nimbed gloriously with
the gold of the rising sun.&nbsp; He listened to the vague sounds
of waking within the house: and suddenly he became aware of Luiz
standing by the hammock&mdash;obviously troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tse!&nbsp; Tse!&nbsp; Tse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what now?&nbsp; Trouble with the boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, master.&nbsp; The gentleman when I take him his
bath water he speak to me.&nbsp; He ask me&mdash;he
ask&mdash;when, when, I think Mr. Walter, he come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-caste&rsquo;s teeth chattered slightly.&nbsp;
Renouard got out of the hammock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he is here all the time&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luiz nodded a scared affirmative, but at once protested,
&ldquo;I no see him.&nbsp; I never.&nbsp; Not I!&nbsp; The
ignorant wild boys say they see . . . Something!&nbsp;
Ough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He clapped his teeth on another short rattle, and stood there,
shrunk, blighted, like a man in a freezing blast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you say to the gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;and I clear out.&nbsp;
I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like to speak of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&nbsp; We shall try to lay that poor
ghost,&rdquo; said Renouard gloomily, going off to a small hut
near by to dress.&nbsp; He was saying to himself: &ldquo;This
fellow will end by giving me away.&nbsp; The last thing that I .
. . No!&nbsp; That mustn&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;&nbsp; And feeling his
hand being forced he discovered the whole extent of his
cowardice.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>
<p>That morning wandering about his plantation, more like a
frightened soul than its creator and master, he dodged the white
parasol bobbing up here and there like a buoy adrift on a sea of
dark-green plants.&nbsp; The crop promised to be magnificent, and
the fashionable philosopher of the age took other than a merely
scientific interest in the experiment.&nbsp; His investments were
judicious, but he had always some little money lying by, for
experiments.</p>
<p>After lunch, being left alone with Renouard, he talked a
little of cultivation and such matters.&nbsp; Then suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, is it true what my sister tells me, that
your plantation boys have been disturbed by a ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard, who since the ladies had left the table was not
keeping such a strict watch on himself, came out of his
abstraction with a start and a stiff smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My foreman had some trouble with them during my
absence.&nbsp; They funk working in a certain field on the slope
of the hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ghost here!&rdquo; exclaimed the amused
professor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then our whole conception of the
psychology of ghosts must be revised.&nbsp; This island has been
uninhabited probably since the dawn of ages.&nbsp; How did a
ghost come here.&nbsp; By air or water?&nbsp; And why did it
leave its native haunts.&nbsp; Was it from misanthropy?&nbsp; Was
he expelled from some community of spirits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard essayed to respond in the same tone.&nbsp; The words
died on his lips.&nbsp; Was it a man or a woman ghost, the
professor inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;&nbsp; Renouard made an
effort to appear at ease.&nbsp; He had, he said, a couple of
Tahitian amongst his boys&mdash;a ghost-ridden race.&nbsp; They
had started the scare.&nbsp; They had probably brought their
ghost with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us investigate the matter, Renouard,&rdquo;
proposed the professor half in earnest.&nbsp; &ldquo;We may make
some interesting discoveries as to the state of primitive minds,
at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was too much.&nbsp; Renouard jumped up and leaving the
room went out and walked about in front of the house.&nbsp; He
would allow no one to force his hand.&nbsp; Presently the
professor joined him outside.&nbsp; He carried his parasol, but
had neither his book nor his pipe with him.&nbsp; Amiably serious
he laid his hand on his &ldquo;dear young friend&rsquo;s&rdquo;
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all of us a little strung up,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;For my part I have been like sister Anne in
the story.&nbsp; But I cannot see anything coming.&nbsp; Anything
that would be the least good for anybody&mdash;I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard had recovered sufficiently to murmur coldly his
regret of this waste of time.&nbsp; For that was what, he
supposed, the professor had in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time,&rdquo; mused Professor Moorsom.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know that time can be wasted.&nbsp; But I will tell
you, my dear friend, what this is: it is an awful waste of
life.&nbsp; I mean for all of us.&nbsp; Even for my sister, who
has got a headache and is gone to lie down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook gently Renouard&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, for
all of us!&nbsp; One may meditate on life endlessly, one may even
have a poor opinion of it&mdash;but the fact remains that we have
only one life to live.&nbsp; And it is short.&nbsp; Think of
that, my young friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He released Renouard&rsquo;s arm and stepped out of the shade
opening his parasol.&nbsp; It was clear that there was something
more in his mind than mere anxiety about the date of his lectures
for fashionable audiences.&nbsp; What did the man mean by his
confounded platitudes?&nbsp; To Renouard, scared by Luiz in the
morning (for he felt that nothing could be more fatal than to
have his deception unveiled otherwise than by personal
confession), this talk sounded like encouragement or a warning
from that man who seemed to him to be very brazen and very
subtle.&nbsp; It was like being bullied by the dead and cajoled
by the living into a throw of dice for a supreme stake.</p>
<p>Renouard went away to some distance from the house and threw
himself down in the shade of a tree.&nbsp; He lay there perfectly
still with his forehead resting on his folded arms, light-headed
and thinking.&nbsp; It seemed to him that he must be on fire,
then that he had fallen into a cool whirlpool, a smooth funnel of
water swirling about with nauseating rapidity.&nbsp; And then (it
must have been a reminiscence of his boyhood) he was walking on
the dangerous thin ice of a river, unable to turn back. . . .
Suddenly it parted from shore to shore with a loud crack like the
report of a gun.</p>
<p>With one leap he found himself on his feet.&nbsp; All was
peace, stillness, sunshine.&nbsp; He walked away from there
slowly.&nbsp; Had he been a gambler he would have perhaps been
supported in a measure by the mere excitement.&nbsp; But he was
not a gambler.&nbsp; He had always disdained that artificial
manner of challenging the fates.&nbsp; The bungalow came into
view, bright and pretty, and all about everything was peace,
stillness, sunshine. . . .</p>
<p>While he was plodding towards it he had a disagreeable sense
of the dead man&rsquo;s company at his elbow.&nbsp; The
ghost!&nbsp; He seemed to be everywhere but in his grave.&nbsp;
Could one ever shake him off? he wondered.&nbsp; At that moment
Miss Moorsom came out on the verandah; and at once, as if by a
mystery of radiating waves, she roused a great tumult in his
heart, shook earth and sky together&mdash;but he plodded
on.&nbsp; Then like a grave song-note in the storm her voice came
to him ominously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Mr. Renouard. . . &rdquo;&nbsp; He came up
and smiled, but she was very serious.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
keep still any longer.&nbsp; Is there time to walk up this
headland and back before dark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shadows were lying lengthened on the ground; all was
stillness and peace.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Renouard,
feeling suddenly as steady as a rock.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I can show
you a view from the central hill which your father has not
seen.&nbsp; A view of reefs and of broken water without end, and
of great wheeling clouds of sea-birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came down the verandah steps at once and they moved
off.&nbsp; &ldquo;You go first,&rdquo; he proposed, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll direct you.&nbsp; To the left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was wearing a short nankin skirt, a muslin blouse; he
could see through the thin stuff the skin of her shoulders, of
her arms.&nbsp; The noble delicacy of her neck caused him a sort
of transport.&nbsp; &ldquo;The path begins where these three
palms are.&nbsp; The only palms on the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She never turned her head.&nbsp; After a while she observed:
&ldquo;This path looks as if it had been made
recently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite recently,&rdquo; he assented very low.</p>
<p>They went on climbing steadily without exchanging another
word; and when they stood on the top she gazed a long time before
her.&nbsp; The low evening mist veiled the further limit of the
reefs.&nbsp; Above the enormous and melancholy confusion, as of a
fleet of wrecked islands, the restless myriads of sea-birds
rolled and unrolled dark ribbons on the sky, gathered in clouds,
soared and stooped like a play of shadows, for they were too far
for them to hear their cries.</p>
<p>Renouard broke the silence in low tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be settling for the night
presently.&rdquo;&nbsp; She made no sound.&nbsp; Round them all
was peace and declining sunshine.&nbsp; Near by, the topmost
pinnacle of Malata, resembling the top of a buried tower, rose a
rock, weather-worn, grey, weary of watching the monotonous
centuries of the Pacific.&nbsp; Renouard leaned his shoulders
against it.&nbsp; Felicia Moorsom faced him suddenly, her
splendid black eyes full on his face as though she had made up
her mind at last to destroy his wits once and for all.&nbsp;
Dazzled, he lowered his eyelids slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Renouard!&nbsp; There is something strange in all
this.&nbsp; Tell me where he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answered deliberately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the other side of this rock.&nbsp; I buried him
there myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pressed her hands to her breast, struggled for her breath
for a moment, then: &ldquo;Ohhh! . . . You buried him! . . . What
sort of man are you? . . . You dared not tell! . . . He is
another of your victims? . . . You dared not confess that
evening. . . . You must have killed him.&nbsp; What could he have
done to you? . . . You fastened on him some atrocious quarrel and
. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her vengeful aspect, her poignant cries left him as unmoved as
the weary rock against which he leaned.&nbsp; He only raised his
eyelids to look at her and lowered them slowly.&nbsp; Nothing
more.&nbsp; It silenced her.&nbsp; And as if ashamed she made a
gesture with her hand, putting away from her that thought.&nbsp;
He spoke, quietly ironic at first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! the legendary Renouard of sensitive
idiots&mdash;the ruthless adventurer&mdash;the ogre with a
future.&nbsp; That was a parrot cry, Miss Moorsom.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think that the greatest fool of them all ever dared
hint such a stupid thing of me that I killed men for
nothing.&nbsp; No, I had noticed this man in a hotel.&nbsp; He
had come from up country I was told, and was doing nothing.&nbsp;
I saw him sitting there lonely in a corner like a sick crow, and
I went over one evening to talk to him.&nbsp; Just on
impulse.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t impressive.&nbsp; He was
pitiful.&nbsp; My worst enemy could have told you he wasn&rsquo;t
good enough to be one of Renouard&rsquo;s victims.&nbsp; It
didn&rsquo;t take me long to judge that he was drugging
himself.&nbsp; Not drinking.&nbsp; Drugs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s now that you are trying to murder
him,&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really.&nbsp; Always the Renouard of shopkeepers&rsquo;
legend.&nbsp; Listen!&nbsp; I would never have been jealous of
him.&nbsp; And yet I am jealous of the air you breathe, of the
soil you tread on, of the world that sees you&mdash;moving
free&mdash;not mine.&nbsp; But never mind.&nbsp; I rather liked
him.&nbsp; For a certain reason I proposed he should come to be
my assistant here.&nbsp; He said he believed this would save
him.&nbsp; It did not save him from death.&nbsp; It came to him
as it were from nothing&mdash;just a fall.&nbsp; A mere slip and
tumble of ten feet into a ravine.&nbsp; But it seems he had been
hurt before up-country&mdash;by a horse.&nbsp; He ailed and
ailed.&nbsp; No, he was not a steel-tipped man.&nbsp; And his
poor soul seemed to have been damaged too.&nbsp; It gave way very
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is tragic!&rdquo; Felicia Moorsom whispered with
feeling.&nbsp; Renouard&rsquo;s lips twitched, but his level
voice continued mercilessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the story.&nbsp; He rallied a little one
night and said he wanted to tell me something.&nbsp; I, being a
gentleman, he said, he could confide in me.&nbsp; I told him that
he was mistaken.&nbsp; That there was a good deal of a plebeian
in me, that he couldn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; He seemed
disappointed.&nbsp; He muttered something about his innocence and
something that sounded like a curse on some woman, then turned to
the wall and&mdash;just grew cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a woman,&rdquo; cried Miss Moorsom
indignantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;What woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder!&rdquo; said Renouard, raising his eyes and
noting the crimson of her ear-lobes against the live whiteness of
her complexion, the sombre, as if secret, night-splendour of her
eyes under the writhing flames of her hair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some
woman who wouldn&rsquo;t believe in that poor innocence of his. .
. Yes.&nbsp; You probably.&nbsp; And now you will not believe in
me&mdash;not even in me who must in truth be what I am&mdash;even
to death.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And yet,
Felicia, a woman like you and a man like me do not often come
together on this earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flame of her glorious head scorched his face.&nbsp; He
flung his hat far away, and his suddenly lowered eyelids brought
out startlingly his resemblance to antique bronze, the profile of
Pallas, still, austere, bowed a little in the shadow of the
rock.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; If you could only understand the
truth that is in me!&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>She waited, as if too astounded to speak, till he looked up
again, and then with unnatural force as if defending herself from
some unspoken aspersion, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s I who stand for truth
here!&nbsp; Believe in you!&nbsp; In you, who by a heartless
falsehood&mdash;and nothing else, nothing else, do you
hear?&mdash;have brought me here, deceived, cheated, as in some
abominable farce!&rdquo;&nbsp; She sat down on a boulder, rested
her chin in her hands, in the pose of simple grief&mdash;mourning
for herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It only wanted this.&nbsp; Why!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Why is
it that ugliness, ridicule, and baseness must fall across my
path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On that height, alone with the sky, they spoke to each other
as if the earth had fallen away from under their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you grieving for your dignity?&nbsp; He was a
mediocre soul and could have given you but an unworthy
existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not even smile at those words, but, superb, as if
lifting a corner of the veil, she turned on him slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you imagine I would have devoted myself to him
for such a purpose!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know that reparation
was due to him from me?&nbsp; A sacred debt&mdash;a fine
duty.&nbsp; To redeem him would not have been in my power&mdash;I
know it.&nbsp; But he was blameless, and it was for me to come
forward.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see that in the eyes of the world
nothing could have rehabilitated him so completely as his
marriage with me?&nbsp; No word of evil could be whispered of him
after I had given him my hand.&nbsp; As to giving myself up to
anything less than the shaping of a man&rsquo;s destiny&mdash;if
I thought I could do it I would abhor myself. . . .&rdquo;&nbsp;
She spoke with authority in her deep fascinating, unemotional
voice.&nbsp; Renouard meditated, gloomy, as if over some sinister
riddle of a beautiful sphinx met on the wild road of his
life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Your father was right.&nbsp; You are one of
these aristocrats . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew herself up haughtily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say?&nbsp; My father! . . . I an
aristocrat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean that you are like the men
and women of the time of armours, castles, and great deeds.&nbsp;
Oh, no!&nbsp; They stood on the naked soil, had traditions to be
faithful to, had their feet on this earth of passions and death
which is not a hothouse.&nbsp; They would have been too plebeian
for you since they had to lead, to suffer with, to understand the
commonest humanity.&nbsp; No, you are merely of the topmost
layer, disdainful and superior, the mere pure froth and bubble on
the inscrutable depths which some day will toss you out of
existence.&nbsp; But you are you!&nbsp; You are you!&nbsp; You
are the eternal love itself&mdash;only, O Divinity, it
isn&rsquo;t your body, it is your soul that is made of
foam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She listened as if in a dream.&nbsp; He had succeeded so well
in his effort to drive back the flood of his passion that his
life itself seemed to run with it out of his body.&nbsp; At that
moment he felt as one dead speaking.&nbsp; But the headlong wave
returning with tenfold force flung him on her suddenly, with open
arms and blazing eyes.&nbsp; She found herself like a feather in
his grasp, helpless, unable to struggle, with her feet off the
ground.&nbsp; But this contact with her, maddening like too much
felicity, destroyed its own end.&nbsp; Fire ran through his
veins, turned his passion to ashes, burnt him out and left him
empty, without force&mdash;almost without desire.&nbsp; He let
her go before she could cry out.&nbsp; And she was so used to the
forms of repression enveloping, softening the crude impulses of
old humanity that she no longer believed in their existence as if
it were an exploded legend.&nbsp; She did not recognise what had
happened to her.&nbsp; She came safe out of his arms, without a
struggle, not even having felt afraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of this?&rdquo; she said,
outraged but calm in a scornful way.</p>
<p>He got down on his knees in silence, bent low to her very
feet, while she looked down at him, a little surprised, without
animosity, as if merely curious to see what he would do.&nbsp;
Then, while he remained bowed to the ground pressing the hem of
her skirt to his lips, she made a slight movement.&nbsp; He got
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Were you ever so much
mine what could I do with you without your consent?&nbsp;
No.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t conquer a wraith, cold mist, stuff of
dreams, illusion.&nbsp; It must come to you and cling to your
breast.&nbsp; And then!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; And then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All ecstasy, all expression went out of his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Renouard,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;though you can
have no claim on my consideration after having decoyed me here
for the vile purpose, apparently, of gloating over me as your
possible prey, I will tell you that I am not perhaps the
extraordinary being you think I am.&nbsp; You may believe
me.&nbsp; Here I stand for truth itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to me what you are?&rdquo; he
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;At a sign from you I would climb up to the
seventh heaven to bring you down to earth for my own&mdash;and if
I saw you steeped to the lips in vice, in crime, in mud, I would
go after you, take you to my arms&mdash;wear you for an
incomparable jewel on my breast.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s
love&mdash;true love&mdash;the gift and the curse of the
gods.&nbsp; There is no other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The truth vibrating in his voice made her recoil slightly, for
she was not fit to hear it&mdash;not even a little&mdash;not even
one single time in her life.&nbsp; It was revolting to her; and
in her trouble, perhaps prompted by the suggestion of his name or
to soften the harshness of expression, for she was obscurely
moved, she spoke to him in French.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Assez</i>!&nbsp; <i>J&rsquo;ai horreur de tout
cela</i>,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>He was white to his very lips, but he was trembling no
more.&nbsp; The dice had been cast, and not even violence could
alter the throw.&nbsp; She passed by him unbendingly, and he
followed her down the path.&nbsp; After a time she heard him
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your dream is to influence a human
destiny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she answered curtly, unabashed, with a
woman&rsquo;s complete assurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you may rest content.&nbsp; You have done
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders slightly.&nbsp; But just before
reaching the end of the path she relented, stopped, and went back
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you are very anxious for people
to know how near you came to absolute turpitude.&nbsp; You may
rest easy on that point.&nbsp; I shall speak to my father, of
course, and we will agree to say that he has died&mdash;nothing
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Renouard in a lifeless voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He is dead.&nbsp; His very ghost shall be done with
presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went on, but he remained standing stock still in the
dusk.&nbsp; She had already reached the three palms when she
heard behind her a loud peal of laughter, cynical and joyless,
such as is heard in smoking-rooms at the end of a scandalous
story.&nbsp; It made her feel positively faint for a moment.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>
<p>Slowly a complete darkness enveloped Geoffrey Renouard.&nbsp;
His resolution had failed him.&nbsp; Instead of following Felicia
into the house, he had stopped under the three palms, and leaning
against a smooth trunk had abandoned himself to a sense of an
immense deception and the feeling of extreme fatigue.&nbsp; This
walk up the hill and down again was like the supreme effort of an
explorer trying to penetrate the interior of an unknown country,
the secret of which is too well defended by its cruel and barren
nature.&nbsp; Decoyed by a mirage, he had gone too far&mdash;so
far that there was no going back.&nbsp; His strength was at an
end.&nbsp; For the first time in his life he had to give up, and
with a sort of despairing self-possession he tried to understand
the cause of the defeat.&nbsp; He did not ascribe it to that
absurd dead man.</p>
<p>The hesitating shadow of Luiz approached him unnoticed till it
spoke timidly.&nbsp; Renouard started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Dinner waiting?&nbsp; You must
say I beg to be excused.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t come.&nbsp; But I
shall see them to-morrow morning, at the landing place.&nbsp;
Take your orders from the professor as to the sailing of the
schooner.&nbsp; Go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luiz, dumbfounded, retreated into the darkness.&nbsp; Renouard
did not move, but hours afterwards, like the bitter fruit of his
immobility, the words: &ldquo;I had nothing to offer to her
vanity,&rdquo; came from his lips in the silence of the
island.&nbsp; And it was then only that he stirred, only to wear
the night out in restless tramping up and down the various paths
of the plantation.&nbsp; Luiz, whose sleep was made light by the
consciousness of some impending change, heard footsteps passing
by his hut, the firm tread of the master; and turning on his mats
emitted a faint Tse! Tse! Tse! of deep concern.</p>
<p>Lights had been burning in the bungalow almost all through the
night; and with the first sign of day began the bustle of
departure.&nbsp; House boys walked processionally carrying
suit-cases and dressing-bags down to the schooner&rsquo;s boat,
which came to the landing place at the bottom of the
garden.&nbsp; Just as the rising sun threw its golden nimbus
around the purple shape of the headland, the Planter of Malata
was perceived pacing bare-headed the curve of the little
bay.&nbsp; He exchanged a few words with the sailing-master of
the schooner, then remained by the boat, standing very upright,
his eyes on the ground, waiting.</p>
<p>He had not long to wait.&nbsp; Into the cool, overshadowed
garden the professor descended first, and came jauntily down the
path in a lively cracking of small shells.&nbsp; With his closed
parasol hooked on his forearm, and a book in his hand, he
resembled a banal tourist more than was permissible to a man of
his unique distinction.&nbsp; He waved the disengaged arm from a
distance, but at close quarters, arrested before Renouard&rsquo;s
immobility, he made no offer to shake hands.&nbsp; He seemed to
appraise the aspect of the man with a sharp glance, and made up
his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going back by Suez,&rdquo; he began almost
boisterously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been looking up the sailing
lists.&nbsp; If the zephirs of your Pacific are only moderately
propitious I think we are sure to catch the mail boat due in
Marseilles on the 18th of March.&nbsp; This will suit me
excellently. . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; He lowered his tone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My dear young friend, I&rsquo;m deeply grateful to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renouard&rsquo;s set lips moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you grateful to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; In the first place you might have
made us miss the next boat, mightn&rsquo;t you? . . . I
don&rsquo;t thank you for your hospitality.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t
be angry with me for saying that I am truly thankful to escape
from it.&nbsp; But I am grateful to you for what you have done,
and&mdash;for being what you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was difficult to define the flavour of that speech, but
Renouard received it with an austerely equivocal smile.&nbsp; The
professor stepping into the boat opened his parasol and sat down
in the stern-sheets waiting for the ladies.&nbsp; No sound of
human voice broke the fresh silence of the morning while they
walked the broad path, Miss Moorsom a little in advance of her
aunt.</p>
<p>When she came abreast of him Renouard raised his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Mr. Renouard,&rdquo; she said in a low voice,
meaning to pass on; but there was such a look of entreaty in the
blue gleam of his sunken eyes that after an imperceptible
hesitation she laid her hand, which was ungloved, in his extended
palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you condescend to remember me?&rdquo; he asked,
while an emotion with which she was angry made her pale cheeks
flush and her black eyes sparkle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a strange request for you to make,&rdquo; she
said, exaggerating the coldness of her tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&nbsp; Impudent perhaps.&nbsp; Yet I am not so
guilty as you think; and bear in mind that to me you can never
make reparation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reparation?&nbsp; To you!&nbsp; It is you who can offer
me no reparation for the offence against my feelings&mdash;and my
person; for what reparation can be adequate for your odious and
ridiculous plot so scornful in its implication, so humiliating to
my pride.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to remember
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, with a tightening grip, he pulled her nearer to
him, and looking into her eyes with fearless despair&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to.&nbsp; I shall haunt you,&rdquo;
he said firmly.</p>
<p>Her hand was wrenched out of his grasp before he had time to
release it.&nbsp; Felicia Moorsom stepped into the boat, sat down
by the side of her father, and breathed tenderly on her crushed
fingers.</p>
<p>The professor gave her a sidelong look&mdash;nothing
more.&nbsp; But the professor&rsquo;s sister, yet on shore, had
put up her long-handle double eye-glass to look at the
scene.&nbsp; She dropped it with a faint rattle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never in my life heard anything so crude
said to a lady,&rdquo; she murmured, passing before Renouard with
a perfectly erect head.&nbsp; When, a moment afterwards,
softening suddenly, she turned to throw a good-bye to that young
man, she saw only his back in the distance moving towards the
bungalow.&nbsp; She watched him go in&mdash;amazed&mdash;before
she too left the soil of Malata.</p>
<p>Nobody disturbed Renouard in that room where he had shut
himself in to breathe the evanescent perfume of her who for him
was no more, till late in the afternoon when the half-caste was
heard on the other side of the door.</p>
<p>He wanted the master to know that the trader <i>Janet</i> was
just entering the cove.</p>
<p>Renouard&rsquo;s strong voice on his side of the door gave him
most unexpected instructions.&nbsp; He was to pay off the boys
with the cash in the office and arrange with the captain of the
<i>Janet</i> to take every worker away from Malata, returning
them to their respective homes.&nbsp; An order on the Dunster
firm would be given to him in payment.</p>
<p>And again the silence of the bungalow remained unbroken till,
next morning, the half-caste came to report that everything was
done.&nbsp; The plantation boys were embarking now.</p>
<p>Through a crack in the door a hand thrust at him a piece of
paper, and the door slammed to so sharply that Luiz stepped
back.&nbsp; Then approaching cringingly the keyhole, in a
propitiatory tone he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I go too, master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; You too.&nbsp; Everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master stop here alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence.&nbsp; And the half-caste&rsquo;s eyes grew wide with
wonder.&nbsp; But he also, like those &ldquo;ignorant
savages,&rdquo; the plantation boys, was only too glad to leave
an island haunted by the ghost of a white man.&nbsp; He backed
away noiselessly from the mysterious silence in the closed room,
and only in the very doorway of the bungalow allowed himself to
give vent to his feelings by a deprecatory and pained&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tse!&nbsp; Tse!&nbsp; Tse!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>
<p>The Moorsoms did manage to catch the homeward mail boat all
right, but had only twenty-four hours in town.&nbsp; Thus the
sentimental Willie could not see very much of them.&nbsp; This
did not prevent him afterwards from relating at great length,
with manly tears in his eyes, how poor Miss Moorsom&mdash;the
fashionable and clever beauty&mdash;found her betrothed in Malata
only to see him die in her arms.&nbsp; Most people were deeply
touched by the sad story.&nbsp; It was the talk of a good many
days.</p>
<p>But the all-knowing Editor, Renouard&rsquo;s only friend and
crony, wanted to know more than the rest of the world.&nbsp; From
professional incontinence, perhaps, he thirsted for a full cup of
harrowing detail.&nbsp; And when he noticed Renouard&rsquo;s
schooner lying in port day after day he sought the sailing master
to learn the reason.&nbsp; The man told him that such were his
instructions.&nbsp; He had been ordered to lie there a month
before returning to Malata.&nbsp; And the month was nearly
up.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will ask you to give me a passage,&rdquo; said
the Editor.</p>
<p>He landed in the morning at the bottom of the garden and found
peace, stillness, sunshine reigning everywhere, the doors and
windows of the bungalow standing wide open, no sight of a human
being anywhere, the plants growing rank and tall on the deserted
fields.&nbsp; For hours the Editor and the schooner&rsquo;s crew,
excited by the mystery, roamed over the island shouting
Renouard&rsquo;s name; and at last set themselves in grim silence
to explore systematically the uncleared bush and the deeper
ravines in search of his corpse.&nbsp; What had happened?&nbsp;
Had he been murdered by the boys?&nbsp; Or had he simply,
capricious and secretive, abandoned his plantation taking the
people with him.&nbsp; It was impossible to tell what had
happened.&nbsp; At last, towards the decline of the day, the
Editor and the sailing master discovered a track of sandals
crossing a strip of sandy beach on the north shore of the
bay.&nbsp; Following this track fearfully, they passed round the
spur of the headland, and there on a large stone found the
sandals, Renouard&rsquo;s white jacket, and the Malay sarong of
chequered pattern which the planter of Malata was well known to
wear when going to bathe.&nbsp; These things made a little heap,
and the sailor remarked, after gazing at it in silence&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Birds have been hovering over this for many a
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone bathing and got drowned,&rdquo; cried
the Editor in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it, sir.&nbsp; If he had been drowned anywhere
within a mile from the shore the body would have been washed out
on the reefs.&nbsp; And our boats have found nothing so
far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing was ever found&mdash;and Renouard&rsquo;s
disappearance remained in the main inexplicable.&nbsp; For to
whom could it have occurred that a man would set out calmly to
swim beyond the confines of life&mdash;with a steady
stroke&mdash;his eyes fixed on a star!</p>
<p>Next evening, from the receding schooner, the Editor looked
back for the last time at the deserted island.&nbsp; A black
cloud hung listlessly over the high rock on the middle hill; and
under the mysterious silence of that shadow Malata lay mournful,
with an air of anguish in the wild sunset, as if remembering the
heart that was broken there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that be hanged for a silly yarn.&nbsp; The boatmen
here in Westport have been telling this lie to the summer
visitors for years.&nbsp; The sort that gets taken out for a row
at a shilling a head&mdash;and asks foolish questions&mdash;must
be told something to pass the time away.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye know
anything more silly than being pulled in a boat along a beach? .
. . It&rsquo;s like drinking weak lemonade when you aren&rsquo;t
thirsty.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why they do it!&nbsp; They
don&rsquo;t even get sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A forgotten glass of beer stood at his elbow; the locality was
a small respectable smoking-room of a small respectable hotel,
and a taste for forming chance acquaintances accounts for my
sitting up late with him.&nbsp; His great, flat, furrowed cheeks
were shaven; a thick, square wisp of white hairs hung from his
chin; its waggling gave additional point to his deep utterance;
and his general contempt for mankind with its activities and
moralities was expressed in the rakish set of his big soft hat of
black felt with a large rim, which he kept always on his
head.</p>
<p>His appearance was that of an old adventurer, retired after
many unholy experiences in the darkest parts of the earth; but I
had every reason to believe that he had never been outside
England.&nbsp; From a casual remark somebody dropped I gathered
that in his early days he must have been somehow connected with
shipping&mdash;with ships in docks.&nbsp; Of individuality he had
plenty.&nbsp; And it was this which attracted my attention at
first.&nbsp; But he was not easy to classify, and before the end
of the week I gave him up with the vague definition, &ldquo;an
imposing old ruffian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One rainy afternoon, oppressed by infinite boredom, I went
into the smoking-room.&nbsp; He was sitting there in absolute
immobility, which was really fakir-like and impressive.&nbsp; I
began to wonder what could be the associations of that sort of
man, his &ldquo;milieu,&rdquo; his private connections, his
views, his morality, his friends, and even his wife&mdash;when to
my surprise he opened a conversation in a deep, muttering
voice.</p>
<p>I must say that since he had learned from somebody that I was
a writer of stories he had been acknowledging my existence by
means of some vague growls in the morning.</p>
<p>He was essentially a taciturn man.&nbsp; There was an effect
of rudeness in his fragmentary sentences.&nbsp; It was some time
before I discovered that what he would be at was the process by
which stories&mdash;stories for periodicals&mdash;were
produced.</p>
<p>What could one say to a fellow like that?&nbsp; But I was
bored to death; the weather continued impossible; and I resolved
to be amiable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you make these tales up on your own.&nbsp; How
do they ever come into your head?&rdquo; he rumbled.</p>
<p>I explained that one generally got a hint for a tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of hint?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for instance,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I got myself
rowed out to the rocks the other day.&nbsp; My boatman told me of
the wreck on these rocks nearly twenty years ago.&nbsp; That
could be used as a hint for a mainly descriptive bit of story
with some such title as &lsquo;In the Channel,&rsquo; for
instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was then that he flew out at the boatmen and the summer
visitors who listen to their tales.&nbsp; Without moving a muscle
of his face he emitted a powerful &ldquo;Rot,&rdquo; from
somewhere out of the depths of his chest, and went on in his
hoarse, fragmentary mumble.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stare at the silly
rocks&mdash;nod their silly heads [the visitors, I
presume].&nbsp; What do they think a man is&mdash;blown-out paper
bag or what?&mdash;go off pop like that when he&rsquo;s
hit&mdash;Damn silly yarn&mdash;Hint indeed! . . . A
lie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You must imagine this statuesque ruffian enhaloed in the black
rim of his hat, letting all this out as an old dog growls
sometimes, with his head up and staring-away eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, but even
if untrue it <i>is</i> a hint, enabling me to see these rocks,
this gale they speak of, the heavy seas, etc., etc., in relation
to mankind.&nbsp; The struggle against natural forces and the
effect of the issue on at least one, say,
exalted&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He interrupted me by an aggressive&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would truth be any good to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like to say,&rdquo; I answered,
cautiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s said that truth is stranger
than fiction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who says that?&rdquo; he mouthed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; Nobody in particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned to the window; for the contemptuous beggar was
oppressive to look at, with his immovable arm on the table.&nbsp;
I suppose my unceremonious manner provoked him to a comparatively
long speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see such a silly lot of rocks?&nbsp; Like
plums in a slice of cold pudding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was looking at them&mdash;an acre or more of black dots
scattered on the steel-grey shades of the level sea, under the
uniform gossamer grey mist with a formless brighter patch in one
place&mdash;the veiled whiteness of the cliff coming through,
like a diffused, mysterious radiance.&nbsp; It was a delicate and
wonderful picture, something expressive, suggestive, and
desolate, a symphony in grey and black&mdash;a Whistler.&nbsp;
But the next thing said by the voice behind me made me turn
round.&nbsp; It growled out contempt for all associated notions
of roaring seas with concise energy, then went on&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;no such foolishness&mdash;looking at the rocks
out there&mdash;more likely call to mind an office&mdash;I used
to look in sometimes at one time&mdash;office in London&mdash;one
of them small streets behind Cannon Street Station. . .
&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was very deliberate; not jerky, only fragmentary; at times
profane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a rather remote connection,&rdquo; I
observed, approaching him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Connection?&nbsp; To Hades with your connections.&nbsp;
It was an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;an accident has its
backward and forward connections, which, if they could be set
forth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without moving he seemed to lend an attentive ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye!&nbsp; Set forth.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s perhaps what
you could do.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t you now?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
no sea life in this connection.&nbsp; But you can put it in out
of your head&mdash;if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I could, if necessary,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sometimes it pays to put in a lot out of one&rsquo;s head,
and sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I mean that the story
isn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp; Everything&rsquo;s in
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It amused me to talk to him like this.&nbsp; He reflected
audibly that he guessed story-writers were out after money like
the rest of the world which had to live by its wits: and that it
was extraordinary how far people who were out after money would
go. . . Some of them.</p>
<p>Then he made a sally against sea life.&nbsp; Silly sort of
life, he called it.&nbsp; No opportunities, no experience, no
variety, nothing.&nbsp; Some fine men came out of it&mdash;he
admitted&mdash;but no more chance in the world if put to it than
fly.&nbsp; Kids.&nbsp; So Captain Harry Dunbar.&nbsp; Good
sailor.&nbsp; Great name as a skipper.&nbsp; Big man; short
side-whiskers going grey, fine face, loud voice.&nbsp; A good
fellow, but no more up to people&rsquo;s tricks than a baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the captain of the <i>Sagamore</i>
you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; I said, confidently.</p>
<p>After a low, scornful &ldquo;Of course&rdquo; he seemed now to
hold on the wall with his fixed stare the vision of that city
office, &ldquo;at the back of Cannon Street Station,&rdquo; while
he growled and mouthed a fragmentary description, jerking his
chin up now and then, as if angry.</p>
<p>It was, according to his account, a modest place of business,
not shady in any sense, but out of the way, in a small street now
rebuilt from end to end.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seven doors from the
Cheshire Cat public house under the railway bridge.&nbsp; I used
to take my lunch there when my business called me to the
city.&nbsp; Cloete would come in to have his chop and make the
girl laugh.&nbsp; No need to talk much, either, for that.&nbsp;
Nothing but the way he would twinkle his spectacles on you and
give a twitch of his thick mouth was enough to start you off
before he began one of his little tales.&nbsp; Funny fellow,
Cloete.&nbsp; C-l-o-e-t-e&mdash;Cloete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was he&mdash;a Dutchman?&rdquo; I asked, not
seeing in the least what all this had to do with the Westport
boatmen and the Westport summer visitors and this extraordinary
old fellow&rsquo;s irritable view of them as liars and
fools.&nbsp; &ldquo;Devil knows,&rdquo; he grunted, his eyes on
the wall as if not to miss a single movement of a cinematograph
picture.&nbsp; &ldquo;Spoke nothing but English, anyway.&nbsp;
First I saw him&mdash;comes off a ship in dock from the
States&mdash;passenger.&nbsp; Asks me for a small hotel near
by.&nbsp; Wanted to be quiet and have a look round for a few
days.&nbsp; I took him to a place&mdash;friend of mine. . . Next
time&mdash;in the City&mdash;Hallo!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re very
obliging&mdash;have a drink.&nbsp; Talks plenty about
himself.&nbsp; Been years in the States.&nbsp; All sorts of
business all over the place.&nbsp; With some patent medicine
people, too.&nbsp; Travels.&nbsp; Writes advertisements and all
that.&nbsp; Tells me funny stories.&nbsp; Tall, loose-limbed
fellow.&nbsp; Black hair up on end, like a brush; long face, long
legs, long arms, twinkle in his specs, jocular way of
speaking&mdash;in a low voice. . . See that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded, but he was not looking at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never laughed so much in my life.&nbsp; The
beggar&mdash;would make you laugh telling you how he skinned his
own father.&nbsp; He was up to that, too.&nbsp; A man who&rsquo;s
been in the patent-medicine trade will be up to anything from
pitch-and-toss to wilful murder.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s a bit of
hard truth for you.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t mind what they
do&mdash;think they can carry off anything and talk themselves
out of anything&mdash;all the world&rsquo;s a fool to them.&nbsp;
Business man, too, Cloete.&nbsp; Came over with a few hundred
pounds.&nbsp; Looking for something to do&mdash;in a quiet
way.&nbsp; Nothing like the old country, after all, says he. . .
And so we part&mdash;I with more drinks in me than I was used
to.&nbsp; After a time, perhaps six months or so, I run up
against him again in Mr. George Dunbar&rsquo;s office.&nbsp; Yes,
<i>that</i> office.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t often that I . . .
However, there was a bit of his cargo in a ship in dock that I
wanted to ask Mr. George about.&nbsp; In comes Cloete out of the
room at the back with some papers in his hand.&nbsp;
Partner.&nbsp; You understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The few hundred
pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that tongue of his,&rdquo; he growled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that tongue.&nbsp; Some of his tales
must have opened George Dunbar&rsquo;s eyes a bit as to what
business means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A plausible fellow,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&nbsp; You must have it in your own
way&mdash;of course.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; Partner.&nbsp; George
Dunbar puts his top-hat on and tells me to wait a moment. . .
George always looked as though he were making a few thousands a
year&mdash;a city swell. . . Come along, old man!&nbsp; And he
and Captain Harry go out together&mdash;some business with a
solicitor round the corner.&nbsp; Captain Harry, when he was in
England, used to turn up in his brother&rsquo;s office regularly
about twelve.&nbsp; Sat in a corner like a good boy, reading the
paper and smoking his pipe.&nbsp; So they go out. . . Model
brothers, says Cloete&mdash;two love-birds&mdash;I am looking
after the tinned-fruit side of this cozy little show. . . Gives
me that sort of talk.&nbsp; Then by-and-by: What sort of old
thing is that <i>Sagamore</i>? Finest ship out&mdash;eh?&nbsp; I
dare say all ships are fine to you.&nbsp; You live by them.&nbsp;
I tell you what; I would just as soon put my money into an old
stocking.&nbsp; Sooner!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>He drew a breath, and I noticed his hand, lying loosely on the
table, close slowly into a fist.&nbsp; In that immovable man it
was startling, ominous, like the famed nod of the Commander.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, already at that
time&mdash;note&mdash;already,&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But hold on,&rdquo; I interrupted.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
<i>Sagamore</i> belonged to Mundy and Rogers, I&rsquo;ve been
told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He snorted contemptuously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Damn
boatmen&mdash;know no better.&nbsp; Flew the firm&rsquo;s
<i>house-flag</i>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s another thing.&nbsp;
Favour.&nbsp; It was like this: When old man Dunbar died, Captain
Harry was already in command with the firm.&nbsp; George chucked
the bank he was clerking in&mdash;to go on his own with what
there was to share after the old chap.&nbsp; George was a smart
man.&nbsp; Started warehousing; then two or three things at a
time: wood-pulp, preserved-fruit trade, and so on.&nbsp; And
Captain Harry let him have his share to work with. . . I am
provided for in my ship, he says. . . But by-and-by Mundy and
Rogers begin to sell out to foreigners all their ships&mdash;go
into steam right away.&nbsp; Captain Harry gets very
upset&mdash;lose command, part with the ship he was fond
of&mdash;very wretched.&nbsp; Just then, so it happened, the
brothers came in for some money&mdash;an old woman died or
something.&nbsp; Quite a tidy bit.&nbsp; Then young George says:
There&rsquo;s enough between us two to buy the <i>Sagamore</i>
with. . . But you&rsquo;ll need more money for your business,
cries Captain Harry&mdash;and the other laughs at him: My
business is going on all right.&nbsp; Why, I can go out and make
a handful of sovereigns while you are trying to get your pipe to
draw, old man. . . Mundy and Rogers very friendly about it:
Certainly, Captain.&nbsp; And we will manage her for you, if you
like, as if she were still our own. . . Why, with a connection
like that it was good investment to buy that ship.&nbsp;
Good!&nbsp; Aye, at the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The turning of his head slightly toward me at this point was
like a sign of strong feeling in any other man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll mind that this was long before Cloete came
into it at all,&rdquo; he muttered, warningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I will mind,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
generally say: some years passed.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s soon
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He eyed me for a while silently in an unseeing way, as if
engrossed in the thought of the years so easily dealt with; his
own years, too, they were, the years before and the years (not so
many) after Cloete came upon the scene.&nbsp; When he began to
speak again, I discerned his intention to point out to me, in his
obscure and graphic manner, the influence on George Dunbar of
long association with Cloete&rsquo;s easy moral standards,
unscrupulously persuasive gift of humour (funny fellow), and
adventurously reckless disposition.&nbsp; He desired me anxiously
to elaborate this view, and I assured him it was quite within my
powers.&nbsp; He wished me also to understand that George&rsquo;s
business had its ups and downs (the other brother was meantime
sailing to and fro serenely); that he got into low water at
times, which worried him rather, because he had married a young
wife with expensive tastes.&nbsp; He was having a pretty anxious
time of it generally; and just then Cloete ran up in the city
somewhere against a man working a patent medicine (the
fellow&rsquo;s old trade) with some success, but which, with
capital, capital to the tune of thousands to be spent with both
hands on advertising, could be turned into a great
thing&mdash;infinitely better-paying than a gold-mine.&nbsp;
Cloete became excited at the possibilities of that sort of
business, in which he was an expert.&nbsp; I understood that
George&rsquo;s partner was all on fire from the contact with this
unique opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he goes in every day into George&rsquo;s room about
eleven, and sings that tune till George gnashes his teeth with
rage.&nbsp; Do shut up.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the good?&nbsp; No
money.&nbsp; Hardly any to go on with, let alone pouring
thousands into advertising.&nbsp; Never dare propose to his
brother Harry to sell the ship.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t think of
it.&nbsp; Worry him to death.&nbsp; It would be like the end of
the world coming.&nbsp; And certainly not for a business of that
kind! . . . Do you think it would be a swindle? asks Cloete,
twitching his mouth. . . George owns up: No&mdash;would be no
better than a squeamish ass if he thought that, after all these
years in business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloete looks at him hard&mdash;Never thought of
<i>selling</i> the ship.&nbsp; Expected the blamed old thing
wouldn&rsquo;t fetch half her insured value by this time.&nbsp;
Then George flies out at him.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the meaning,
then, of these silly jeers at ship-owning for the last three
weeks?&nbsp; Had enough of them, anyhow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angry at having his mouth made to water, see.&nbsp;
Cloete don&rsquo;t get excited. . . I am no squeamish ass,
either, says he, very slowly.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t selling
your old <i>Sagamore</i> wants.&nbsp; The blamed thing wants
tomahawking (seems the name <i>Sagamore</i> means an Indian chief
or something.&nbsp; The figure-head was a half-naked savage with
a feather over one ear and a hatchet in his belt).&nbsp;
Tomahawking, says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? asks George. . . Wrecking&mdash;it
could be managed with perfect safety, goes on Cloete&mdash;your
brother would then put in his share of insurance money.&nbsp;
Needn&rsquo;t tell him exactly what for.&nbsp; He thinks
you&rsquo;re the smartest business man that ever lived.&nbsp;
Make his fortune, too. . . George grips the desk with both hands
in his rage. . . You think my brother&rsquo;s a man to cast away
his ship on purpose.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t even dare think of
such a thing in the same room with him&mdash;the finest fellow
that ever lived. . . Don&rsquo;t make such noise; they&rsquo;ll
hear you outside, says Cloete; and he tells him that his brother
is the salted pattern of all virtues, but all that&rsquo;s
necessary is to induce him to stay ashore for a voyage&mdash;for
a holiday&mdash;take a rest&mdash;why not? . . . In fact, I have
in view somebody up to that sort of game&mdash;Cloete
whispers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;George nearly chokes. . . So you think I am of that
sort&mdash;you think <i>me</i> capable&mdash;What do you take me
for? . . . He almost loses his head, while Cloete keeps cool,
only gets white about the gills. . . I take you for a man who
will be most cursedly hard up before long. . . He goes to the
door and sends away the clerks&mdash;there were only two&mdash;to
take their lunch hour.&nbsp; Comes back . . . What are you
indignant about?&nbsp; Do I want you to rob the widow and
orphan?&nbsp; Why, man!&nbsp; Lloyd&rsquo;s a corporation, it
hasn&rsquo;t got a body to starve.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s forty or
more of them perhaps who underwrote the lines on that silly ship
of yours.&nbsp; Not one human being would go hungry or cold for
it.&nbsp; They take every risk into consideration.&nbsp;
Everything I tell you. . . That sort of talk.&nbsp;
H&rsquo;m!&nbsp; George too upset to speak&mdash;only gurgles and
waves his arms; so sudden, you see.&nbsp; The other, warming his
back at the fire, goes on.&nbsp; Wood-pulp business next door to
a failure.&nbsp; Tinned-fruit trade nearly played out. . .
You&rsquo;re frightened, he says; but the law is only meant to
frighten fools away. . . And he shows how safe casting away that
ship would be.&nbsp; Premiums paid for so many, many years.&nbsp;
No shadow of suspicion could arise.&nbsp; And, dash it all! a
ship must meet her end some day. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not frightened.&nbsp; I am indignant,&rdquo; says
George Dunbar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloete boiling with rage inside.&nbsp; Chance of a
lifetime&mdash;his chance!&nbsp; And he says kindly: Your
wife&rsquo;ll be much more indignant when you ask her to get out
of that pretty house of yours and pile in into a two-pair
back&mdash;with kids perhaps, too. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;George had no children.&nbsp; Married a couple of
years; looked forward to a kid or two very much.&nbsp; Feels more
upset than ever.&nbsp; Talks about an honest man for father, and
so on.&nbsp; Cloete grins: You be quick before they come, and
they&rsquo;ll have a rich man for father, and no one the worse
for it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the beauty of the thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;George nearly cries.&nbsp; I believe he did cry at odd
times.&nbsp; This went on for weeks.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t
quarrel with Cloete.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t pay off his few
hundreds; and besides, he was used to have him about.&nbsp; Weak
fellow, George.&nbsp; Cloete generous, too. . . Don&rsquo;t think
of my little pile, says he.&nbsp; Of course it&rsquo;s gone when
we have to shut up.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t care, he says. . .
And then there was George&rsquo;s new wife.&nbsp; When Cloete
dines there, the beggar puts on a dress suit; little woman liked
it; . . . Mr. Cloete, my husband&rsquo;s partner; such a clever
man, man of the world, so amusing! . . . When he dines there and
they are alone: Oh, Mr. Cloete, I wish George would do something
to improve our prospects.&nbsp; Our position is really so
mediocre. . . And Cloete smiles, but isn&rsquo;t surprised,
because he had put all these notions himself into her empty head.
. . What your husband wants is enterprise, a little
audacity.&nbsp; You can encourage him best, Mrs. Dunbar. . . She
was a silly, extravagant little fool.&nbsp; Had made George take
a house in Norwood.&nbsp; Live up to a lot of people better off
than themselves.&nbsp; I saw her once; silk dress, pretty boots,
all feathers and scent, pink face.&nbsp; More like the Promenade
at the Alhambra than a decent home, it looked to me.&nbsp; But
some women do get a devil of a hold on a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, some do,&rdquo; I assented.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even when
the man is the husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My missis,&rdquo; he addressed me unexpectedly, in a
solemn, surprisingly hollow tone, &ldquo;could wind me round her
little finger.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t find it out till she was
gone.&nbsp; Aye.&nbsp; But she was a woman of sense, while that
piece of goods ought to have been walking the streets, and
that&rsquo;s all I can say. . . You must make her up out of your
head.&nbsp; You will know the sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave all that to me,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; he grunted, doubtfully, then going
back to his scornful tone: &ldquo;A month or so afterwards the
<i>Sagamore</i> arrives home.&nbsp; All very jolly at first. . .
Hallo, George boy!&nbsp; Hallo, Harry, old man! . . . But by and
by Captain Harry thinks his clever brother is not looking very
well.&nbsp; And George begins to look worse.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t
get rid of Cloete&rsquo;s notion.&nbsp; It has stuck in his head.
. . There&rsquo;s nothing wrong&mdash;quite well. . . Captain
Harry still anxious.&nbsp; Business going all right, eh?&nbsp;
Quite right.&nbsp; Lots of business.&nbsp; Good business. . . Of
course Captain Harry believes that easily.&nbsp; Starts chaffing
his brother in his jolly way about rolling in money.&nbsp;
George&rsquo;s shirt sticks to his back with perspiration, and he
feels quite angry with the captain. . . The fool, he says to
himself.&nbsp; Rolling in money, indeed!&nbsp; And then he thinks
suddenly: Why not? . . . Because Cloete&rsquo;s notion has got
hold of his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But next day he weakens and says to Cloete . . .
Perhaps it would be best to sell.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t you talk
to my brother? and Cloete explains to him over again for the
twentieth time why selling wouldn&rsquo;t do, anyhow.&nbsp;
No!&nbsp; The <i>Sagamore</i> must be tomahawked&mdash;as he
would call it; to spare George&rsquo;s feelings, maybe.&nbsp; But
every time he says the word, George shudders. . . I&rsquo;ve got
a man at hand competent for the job who will do the trick for
five hundred, and only too pleased at the chance, says Cloete. .
. George shuts his eyes tight at that sort of talk&mdash;but at
the same time he thinks: Humbug!&nbsp; There can be no such
man.&nbsp; And yet if there was such a man it would be safe
enough&mdash;perhaps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Cloete always funny about it.&nbsp; He
couldn&rsquo;t talk about anything without it seeming there was a
great joke in it somewhere. . . Now, says he, I know you are a
moral citizen, George.&nbsp; Morality is mostly funk, and I think
you&rsquo;re the funkiest man I ever came across in my
travels.&nbsp; Why, you are afraid to speak to your
brother.&nbsp; Afraid to open your mouth to him with a fortune
for us all in sight. . . George flares up at this: no, he
ain&rsquo;t afraid; he will speak; bangs fist on the desk.&nbsp;
And Cloete pats him on the back. . . We&rsquo;ll be made men
presently, he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the first time George attempts to speak to Captain
Harry his heart slides down into his boots.&nbsp; Captain Harry
only laughs at the notion of staying ashore.&nbsp; He wants no
holiday, not he.&nbsp; But Jane thinks of remaining in England
this trip.&nbsp; Go about a bit and see some of her people.&nbsp;
Jane was the Captain&rsquo;s wife; round-faced, pleasant
lady.&nbsp; George gives up that time; but Cloete won&rsquo;t let
him rest.&nbsp; So he tries again; and the Captain frowns.&nbsp;
He frowns because he&rsquo;s puzzled.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t make
it out.&nbsp; He has no notion of living away from his
<i>Sagamore</i>. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now I
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he growled, his black,
contemptuous stare turning on me crushingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; I murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&nbsp; Very well, then.&nbsp; Captain Harry
looks very stern, and George crumples all up inside. . . He sees
through me, he thinks. . . Of course it could not be; but George,
by that time, was scared at his own shadow.&nbsp; He is shirking
it with Cloete, too.&nbsp; Gives his partner to understand that
his brother has half a mind to try a spell on shore, and so
on.&nbsp; Cloete waits, gnawing his fingers; so anxious.&nbsp;
Cloete really had found a man for the job.&nbsp; Believe it or
not, he had found him inside the very boarding-house he lodged
in&mdash;somewhere about Tottenham Court Road.&nbsp; He had
noticed down-stairs a fellow&mdash;a boarder and not a
boarder&mdash;hanging about the dark&mdash;part of the passage
mostly; sort of &lsquo;man of the house,&rsquo; a slinking
chap.&nbsp; Black eyes.&nbsp; White face.&nbsp; The woman of the
house&mdash;a widow lady, she called herself&mdash;very full of
Mr. Stafford; Mr. Stafford this and Mr. Stafford that. . .
Anyhow, Cloete one evening takes him out to have a drink.&nbsp;
Cloete mostly passed away his evenings in saloon bars.&nbsp; No
drunkard, though, Cloete; for company; liked to talk to all sorts
there; just habit; American fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Cloete takes that chap out more than once.&nbsp; Not
very good company, though.&nbsp; Little to say for himself.&nbsp;
Sits quiet and drinks what&rsquo;s given to him, eyes always half
closed, speaks sort of demure. . . I&rsquo;ve had misfortunes, he
says.&nbsp; The truth was they had kicked him out of a big
steam-ship company for disgraceful conduct; nothing to affect his
certificate, you understand; and he had gone down quite
easily.&nbsp; Liked it, I expect.&nbsp; Anything&rsquo;s better
than work.&nbsp; Lived on the widow lady who kept that
boarding-house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s almost incredible,&rdquo; I ventured to
interrupt.&nbsp; &ldquo;A man with a master&rsquo;s certificate,
do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do; I&rsquo;ve known them &rsquo;bus cads,&rdquo; he
growled, contemptuously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Swing on the
tail-board by the strap and yell, &lsquo;tuppence all the
way.&rsquo;&nbsp; Through drink.&nbsp; But this Stafford was of
another kind.&nbsp; Hell&rsquo;s full of such Staffords; Cloete
would make fun of him, and then there would be a nasty gleam in
the fellow&rsquo;s half-shut eye.&nbsp; But Cloete was generally
kind to him.&nbsp; Cloete was a fellow that would be kind to a
mangy dog.&nbsp; Anyhow, he used to stand drinks to that object,
and now and then gave him half a crown&mdash;because the widow
lady kept Mr. Stafford short of pocket-money.&nbsp; They had rows
almost every day down in the basement. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the fellow being a sailor that put into
Cloete&rsquo;s mind the first notion of doing away with the
<i>Sagamore</i>.&nbsp; He studies him a bit, thinks there&rsquo;s
enough devil in him yet to be tempted, and one evening he says to
him . . . I suppose you wouldn&rsquo;t mind going to sea again,
for a spell? . . . The other never raises his eyes; says
it&rsquo;s scarcely worth one&rsquo;s while for the miserable
salary one gets. . . Well, but what do you say to captain&rsquo;s
wages for a time, and a couple of hundred extra if you are
compelled to come home without the ship.&nbsp; Accidents will
happen, says Cloete. . . Oh! sure to, says that Stafford; and
goes on taking sips of his drink as if he had no interest in the
matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloete presses him a bit; but the other observes,
impudent and languid like: You see, there&rsquo;s no future in a
thing like that&mdash;is there? . . Oh! no, says Cloete.&nbsp;
Certainly not.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean this to have any
future&mdash;as far as you are concerned.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
&lsquo;once for all&rsquo; transaction.&nbsp; Well, what do you
estimate your future at? he asks. . . The fellow more listless
than ever&mdash;nearly asleep.&mdash;I believe the skunk was
really too lazy to care.&nbsp; Small cheating at cards, wheedling
or bullying his living out of some woman or other, was more his
style.&nbsp; Cloete swears at him in whispers something
awful.&nbsp; All this in the saloon bar of the Horse Shoe,
Tottenham Court Road.&nbsp; Finally they agree, over the second
sixpennyworth of Scotch hot, on five hundred pounds as the price
of tomahawking the <i>Sagamore</i>.&nbsp; And Cloete waits to see
what George can do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A week or two goes by.&nbsp; The other fellow loafs
about the house as if there had been nothing, and Cloete begins
to doubt whether he really means ever to tackle that job.&nbsp;
But one day he stops Cloete at the door, with his downcast eyes:
What about that employment you wished to give me? he asks. . .
You see, he had played some more than usual dirty trick on the
woman and expected awful ructions presently; and to be fired out
for sure.&nbsp; Cloete very pleased.&nbsp; George had been
prevaricating to him such a lot that he really thought the thing
was as well as settled.&nbsp; And he says: Yes.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
time I introduced you to my friend.&nbsp; Just get your hat and
we will go now. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two come into the office, and George at his desk
sits up in a sudden panic&mdash;staring.&nbsp; Sees a tallish
fellow, sort of nasty-handsome face, heavy eyes, half shut; short
drab overcoat, shabby bowler hat, very careful&mdash;like in his
movements.&nbsp; And he thinks to himself, Is that how such a man
looks!&nbsp; No, the thing&rsquo;s impossible. . . Cloete does
the introduction, and the fellow turns round to look behind him
at the chair before he sits down. . . A thoroughly competent man,
Cloete goes on . . . The man says nothing, sits perfectly
quiet.&nbsp; And George can&rsquo;t speak, throat too dry.&nbsp;
Then he makes an effort: H&rsquo;m!&nbsp; H&rsquo;m!&nbsp; Oh
yes&mdash;unfortunately&mdash;sorry to disappoint&mdash;my
brother&mdash;made other arrangements&mdash;going himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow gets up, never raising his eyes off the
ground, like a modest girl, and goes out softly, right out of the
office without a sound.&nbsp; Cloete sticks his chin in his hand
and bites all his fingers at once.&nbsp; George&rsquo;s heart
slows down and he speaks to Cloete. . . This can&rsquo;t be
done.&nbsp; How can it be?&nbsp; Directly the ship is lost Harry
would see through it.&nbsp; You know he is a man to go to the
underwriters himself with his suspicions.&nbsp; And he would
break his heart over me.&nbsp; How can I play that on him?&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s only two of us in the world belonging to each
other. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloete lets out a horrid cuss-word, jumps up, bolts
away into his room, and George hears him there banging things
around.&nbsp; After a while he goes to the door and says in a
trembling voice: You ask me for an impossibility. . . Cloete
inside ready to fly out like a tiger and rend him; but he opens
the door a little way and says softly: Talking of hearts, yours
is no bigger than a mouse&rsquo;s, let me tell you. . . But
George doesn&rsquo;t care&mdash;load off the heart, anyhow.&nbsp;
And just then Captain Harry comes in. . . Hallo, George
boy.&nbsp; I am little late.&nbsp; What about a chop at the
Cheshire, now? . . . Right you are, old man. . . And off they go
to lunch together.&nbsp; Cloete has nothing to eat that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;George feels a new man for a time; but all of a sudden
that fellow Stafford begins to hang about the street, in sight of
the house door.&nbsp; The first time George sees him he thinks he
made a mistake.&nbsp; But no; next time he has to go out, there
is the very fellow skulking on the other side of the road.&nbsp;
It makes George nervous; but he must go out on business, and when
the fellow cuts across the road-way he dodges him.&nbsp; He
dodges him once, twice, three times; but at last he gets nabbed
in his very doorway. . . What do you want? he says, trying to
look fierce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that ructions had come in the basement of that
boarding-house, and the widow lady had turned on him (being
jealous mad), to the extent of talking of the police.&nbsp;
<i>That</i> Mr. Stafford couldn&rsquo;t stand; so he cleared out
like a scared stag, and there he was, chucked into the streets,
so to speak.&nbsp; Cloete looked so savage as he went to and fro
that he hadn&rsquo;t the spunk to tackle him; but George seemed a
softer kind to his eye.&nbsp; He would have been glad of half a
quid, anything. . . I&rsquo;ve had misfortunes, he says softly,
in his demure way, which frightens George more than a row would
have done. . . Consider the severity of my disappointment, he
says. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;George, instead of telling him to go to the devil,
loses his head. . . I don&rsquo;t know you.&nbsp; What do you
want? he cries, and bolts up-stairs to Cloete. . . . Look
what&rsquo;s come of it, he gasps; now we are at the mercy of
that horrid fellow. . . Cloete tries to show him that the fellow
can do nothing; but George thinks that some sort of scandal may
be forced on, anyhow.&nbsp; Says that he can&rsquo;t live with
that horror haunting him.&nbsp; Cloete would laugh if he
weren&rsquo;t too weary of it all.&nbsp; Then a thought strikes
him and he changes his tune. . . Well, perhaps!&nbsp; I will go
down-stairs and send him away to begin with. . . He comes back. .
. He&rsquo;s gone.&nbsp; But perhaps you are right.&nbsp; The
fellow&rsquo;s hard up, and that&rsquo;s what makes people
desperate.&nbsp; The best thing would be to get him out of the
country for a time.&nbsp; Look here, the poor devil is really in
want of employment.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t ask you much this time:
only to hold your tongue; and I shall try to get your brother to
take him as chief officer.&nbsp; At this George lays his arms and
his head on his desk, so that Cloete feels sorry for him.&nbsp;
But altogether Cloete feels more cheerful because he has shaken
the ghost a bit into that Stafford.&nbsp; That very afternoon he
buys him a suit of blue clothes, and tells him that he will have
to turn to and work for his living now.&nbsp; Go to sea as mate
of the <i>Sagamore</i>.&nbsp; The skunk wasn&rsquo;t very
willing, but what with having nothing to eat and no place to
sleep in, and the woman having frightened him with the talk of
some prosecution or other, he had no choice, properly
speaking.&nbsp; Cloete takes care of him for a couple of days. .
. Our arrangement still stands, says he.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the
ship bound for Port Elizabeth; not a safe anchorage at all.&nbsp;
Should she by chance part from her anchors in a north-east gale
and get lost on the beach, as many of them do, why, it&rsquo;s
five hundred in your pocket&mdash;and a quick return home.&nbsp;
You are up to the job, ain&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Mr. Stafford takes it all in with downcast eyes. .
. I am a competent seaman, he says, with his sly, modest
air.&nbsp; A ship&rsquo;s chief mate has no doubt many
opportunities to manipulate the chains and anchors to some
purpose. . . At this Cloete thumps him on the back: You&rsquo;ll
do, my noble sailor.&nbsp; Go in and win. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next thing George knows, his brother tells him that he
had occasion to oblige his partner.&nbsp; And glad of it,
too.&nbsp; Likes the partner no end.&nbsp; Took a friend of his
as mate.&nbsp; Man had his troubles, been ashore a year nursing a
dying wife, it seems.&nbsp; Down on his luck. . . George protests
earnestly that he knows nothing of the person.&nbsp; Saw him
once.&nbsp; Not very attractive to look at. . . And Captain Harry
says in his hearty way, That&rsquo;s so, but must give the poor
devil a chance. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Mr. Stafford joins in dock.&nbsp; And it seems that
he did manage to monkey with one of the cables&mdash;keeping his
mind on Port Elizabeth.&nbsp; The riggers had all the cable
ranged on deck to clean lockers.&nbsp; The new mate watches them
go ashore&mdash;dinner hour&mdash;and sends the ship-keeper out
of the ship to fetch him a bottle of beer.&nbsp; Then he goes to
work whittling away the forelock of the forty-five-fathom
shackle-pin, gives it a tap or two with a hammer just to make it
loose, and of course that cable wasn&rsquo;t safe any more.&nbsp;
Riggers come back&mdash;you know what riggers are: come day, go
day, and God send Sunday.&nbsp; Down goes the chain into the
locker without their foreman looking at the shackles at
all.&nbsp; What does he care?&nbsp; He ain&rsquo;t going in the
ship.&nbsp; And two days later the ship goes to sea. . .
&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At this point I was incautious enough to breathe out another
&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; which gave offence again, and brought on me
a rude &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;as before.&nbsp;
But in the pause he remembered the glass of beer at his
elbow.&nbsp; He drank half of it, wiped his mustaches, and
remarked grimly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that there will be any sea life
in this, because there ain&rsquo;t.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re going
to put in any out of your own head, now&rsquo;s your
chance.&nbsp; I suppose you know what ten days of bad weather in
the Channel are like?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Anyway, ten
whole days go by.&nbsp; One Monday Cloete comes to the office a
little late&mdash;hears a woman&rsquo;s voice in George&rsquo;s
room and looks in.&nbsp; Newspapers on the desk, on the floor;
Captain Harry&rsquo;s wife sitting with red eyes and a bag on the
chair near her. . . Look at this, says George, in great
excitement, showing him a paper.&nbsp; Cloete&rsquo;s heart gives
a jump.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Wreck in Westport Bay.&nbsp; The
<i>Sagamore</i> gone ashore early hours of Sunday, and so the
newspaper men had time to put in some of their work.&nbsp;
Columns of it.&nbsp; Lifeboat out twice.&nbsp; Captain and crew
remain by the ship.&nbsp; Tugs summoned to assist.&nbsp; If the
weather improves, this well-known fine ship may yet be saved. . .
You know the way these chaps put it. . . Mrs. Harry there on her
way to catch a train from Cannon Street.&nbsp; Got an hour to
wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloete takes George aside and whispers: Ship saved
yet!&nbsp; Oh, damn!&nbsp; That must never be; you hear?&nbsp;
But George looks at him dazed, and Mrs. Harry keeps on sobbing
quietly: . . . I ought to have been with him.&nbsp; But I am
going to him. . . We are all going together, cries Cloete, all of
a sudden.&nbsp; He rushes out, sends the woman a cup of hot
bovril from the shop across the road, buys a rug for her, thinks
of everything; and in the train tucks her in and keeps on
talking, thirteen to the dozen, all the way, to keep her spirits
up, as it were; but really because he can&rsquo;t hold his peace
for very joy.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the thing done all at once, and
nothing to pay.&nbsp; Done.&nbsp; Actually done.&nbsp; His head
swims now and again when he thinks of it.&nbsp; What enormous
luck!&nbsp; It almost frightens him.&nbsp; He would like to yell
and sing.&nbsp; Meantime George Dunbar sits in his corner,
looking so deadly miserable that at last poor Mrs. Harry tries to
comfort him, and so cheers herself up at the same time by talking
about how her Harry is a prudent man; not likely to risk his
crew&rsquo;s life or his own unnecessarily&mdash;and so on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First thing they hear at Westport station is that the
life-boat has been out to the ship again, and has brought off the
second officer, who had hurt himself, and a few sailors.&nbsp;
Captain and the rest of the crew, about fifteen in all, are still
on board.&nbsp; Tugs expected to arrive every moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They take Mrs. Harry to the inn, nearly opposite the
rocks; she bolts straight up-stairs to look out of the window,
and she lets out a great cry when she sees the wreck.&nbsp; She
won&rsquo;t rest till she gets on board to her Harry.&nbsp;
Cloete soothes her all he can. . . All right; you try to eat a
mouthful, and we will go to make inquiries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He draws George out of the room: Look here, she
can&rsquo;t go on board, but I shall.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll see to it
that he doesn&rsquo;t stop in the ship too long.&nbsp;
Let&rsquo;s go and find the coxswain of the life-boat. . . George
follows him, shivering from time to time.&nbsp; The waves are
washing over the old pier; not much wind, a wild, gloomy sky over
the bay.&nbsp; In the whole world only one tug away off, heading
to the seas, tossed in and out of sight every minute as regular
as clockwork.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They meet the coxswain and he tells them: Yes!&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s going out again.&nbsp; No, they ain&rsquo;t in danger
on board&mdash;not yet.&nbsp; But the ship&rsquo;s chance is very
poor.&nbsp; Still, if the wind doesn&rsquo;t pipe up again and
the sea goes down something might be tried.&nbsp; After some talk
he agrees to take Cloete on board; supposed to be with an urgent
message from the owners to the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever Cloete looks at the sky he feels comforted; it
looks so threatening.&nbsp; George Dunbar follows him about with
a white face and saying nothing.&nbsp; Cloete takes him to have a
drink or two, and by and by he begins to pick up. . .
That&rsquo;s better, says Cloete; dash me if it wasn&rsquo;t like
walking about with a dead man before.&nbsp; You ought to be
throwing up your cap, man.&nbsp; I feel as if I wanted to stand
in the street and cheer.&nbsp; Your brother is safe, the ship is
lost, and we are made men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you certain she&rsquo;s lost? asks George.&nbsp; It
would be an awful blow after all the agonies I have gone through
in my mind, since you first spoke to me, if she were to be got
off&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;all this temptation to begin over
again. . . For we had nothing to do with this; had we?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, says Cloete.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t your
brother himself in charge?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s providential. . . Oh!
cries George, shocked. . . Well, say it&rsquo;s the devil, says
Cloete, cheerfully.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mind!&nbsp; You had
nothing to do with it any more than a baby unborn, you great
softy, you. . . Cloete has got so that he almost loved George
Dunbar.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; That was so.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t mean he respected him.&nbsp; He was just fond of his
partner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They go back, you may say fairly skipping, to the
hotel, and find the wife of the captain at the open window, with
her eyes on the ship as if she wanted to fly across the bay over
there. . . Now then, Mrs. Dunbar, cries Cloete, you can&rsquo;t
go, but I am going.&nbsp; Any messages?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be
shy.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll deliver every word faithfully.&nbsp; And if
you would like to give me a kiss for him, I&rsquo;ll deliver that
too, dash me if I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He makes Mrs. Harry laugh with his patter. . . Oh, dear
Mr. Cloete, you are a calm, reasonable man.&nbsp; Make him behave
sensibly.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a bit obstinate, you know, and
he&rsquo;s so fond of the ship, too.&nbsp; Tell him I am
here&mdash;looking on. . . Trust me, Mrs. Dunbar.&nbsp; Only shut
that window, that&rsquo;s a good girl.&nbsp; You will be sure to
catch cold if you don&rsquo;t, and the Captain won&rsquo;t be
pleased coming off the wreck to find you coughing and sneezing so
that you can&rsquo;t tell him how happy you are.&nbsp; And now if
you can get me a bit of tape to fasten my glasses on good to my
ears, I will be going. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;How he gets on board I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; All wet
and shaken and excited and out of breath, he does get on
board.&nbsp; Ship lying over, smothered in sprays, but not moving
very much; just enough to jag one&rsquo;s nerve a bit.&nbsp; He
finds them all crowded on the deck-house forward, in their shiny
oilskins, with faces like sick men.&nbsp; Captain Harry
can&rsquo;t believe his eyes.&nbsp; What!&nbsp; Mr. Cloete!&nbsp;
What are you doing here, in God&rsquo;s name? . . . Your
wife&rsquo;s ashore there, looking on, gasps out Cloete; and
after they had talked a bit, Captain Harry thinks it&rsquo;s
uncommonly plucky and kind of his brother&rsquo;s partner to come
off to him like this.&nbsp; Man glad to have somebody to talk to.
. . It&rsquo;s a bad business, Mr. Cloete, he says.&nbsp; And
Cloete rejoices to hear that.&nbsp; Captain Harry thinks he had
done his best, but the cable had parted when he tried to anchor
her.&nbsp; It was a great trial to lose the ship.&nbsp; Well, he
would have to face it.&nbsp; He fetches a deep sigh now and
then.&nbsp; Cloete almost sorry he had come on board, because to
be on that wreck keeps his chest in a tight band all the
time.&nbsp; They crouch out of the wind under the port boat, a
little apart from the men.&nbsp; The life-boat had gone away
after putting Cloete on board, but was coming back next high
water to take off the crew if no attempt at getting the ship
afloat could be made.&nbsp; Dusk was falling; winter&rsquo;s day;
black sky; wind rising.&nbsp; Captain Harry felt
melancholy.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s will be done.&nbsp; If she must be
left on the rocks&mdash;why, she must.&nbsp; A man should take
what God sends him standing up. . . Suddenly his voice breaks,
and he squeezes Cloete&rsquo;s arm: It seems as if I
couldn&rsquo;t leave her, he whispers.&nbsp; Cloete looks round
at the men like a lot of huddled sheep and thinks to himself:
They won&rsquo;t stay. . . Suddenly the ship lifts a little and
sets down with a thump.&nbsp; Tide rising.&nbsp; Everybody
beginning to look out for the life-boat.&nbsp; Some of the men
made her out far away and also two more tugs.&nbsp; But the gale
has come on again, and everybody knows that no tug will ever dare
come near the ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the end, Captain Harry says, very low. . .
. Cloete thinks he never felt so cold in all his life. . . And I
feel as if I didn&rsquo;t care to live on just now, mutters
Captain Harry . . . Your wife&rsquo;s ashore, looking on, says
Cloete . . . Yes.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; It must be awful for her to
look at the poor old ship lying here done for.&nbsp; Why,
that&rsquo;s our home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloete thinks that as long as the
<i>Sagamore&rsquo;s</i> done for he doesn&rsquo;t care, and only
wishes himself somewhere else.&nbsp; The slightest movement of
the ship cuts his breath like a blow.&nbsp; And he feels excited
by the danger, too.&nbsp; The captain takes him aside. . . The
life-boat can&rsquo;t come near us for more than an hour.&nbsp;
Look here, Cloete, since you are here, and such a plucky
one&mdash;do something for me. . . He tells him then that down in
his cabin aft in a certain drawer there is a bundle of important
papers and some sixty sovereigns in a small canvas bag.&nbsp;
Asks Cloete to go and get these things out.&nbsp; He hasn&rsquo;t
been below since the ship struck, and it seems to him that if he
were to take his eyes off her she would fall to pieces.&nbsp; And
then the men&mdash;a scared lot by this time&mdash;if he were to
leave them by themselves they would attempt to launch one of the
ship&rsquo;s boats in a panic at some heavier thump&mdash;and
then some of them bound to get drowned. . . There are two or
three boxes of matches about my shelves in my cabin if you want a
light, says Captain Harry.&nbsp; Only wipe your wet hands before
you begin to feel for them. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloete doesn&rsquo;t like the job, but doesn&rsquo;t
like to show funk, either&mdash;and he goes.&nbsp; Lots of water
on the main-deck, and he splashes along; it was getting dark,
too.&nbsp; All at once, by the mainmast, somebody catches him by
the arm.&nbsp; Stafford.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t thinking of
Stafford at all.&nbsp; Captain Harry had said something as to the
mate not being quite satisfactory, but it wasn&rsquo;t
much.&nbsp; Cloete doesn&rsquo;t recognise him in his oilskins at
first.&nbsp; He sees a white face with big eyes peering at him. .
. Are you pleased, Mr. Cloete . . . ?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloete is moved to laugh at the whine, and shakes him
off.&nbsp; But the fellow scrambles on after him on the poop and
follows him down into the cabin of that wrecked ship.&nbsp; And
there they are, the two of them; can hardly see each other. . .
You don&rsquo;t mean to make me believe you have had anything to
do with this, says Cloete. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;They both shiver, nearly out of their wits with the
excitement of being on board that ship.&nbsp; She thumps and
lurches, and they stagger together, feeling sick.&nbsp; Cloete
again bursts out laughing at that wretched creature Stafford
pretending to have been up to something so desperate. . . Is that
how you think you can treat me now? yells the other man all of a
sudden. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sea strikes the stern, the ship trembles and groans
all round them, there&rsquo;s the noise of the seas about and
overhead, confusing Cloete, and he hears the other screaming as
if crazy. . . Ah, you don&rsquo;t believe me!&nbsp; Go and look
at the port chain.&nbsp; Parted?&nbsp; Eh?&nbsp; Go and see if
it&rsquo;s parted.&nbsp; Go and find the broken link.&nbsp; You
can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no broken link.&nbsp; That means
a thousand pounds for me.&nbsp; No less.&nbsp; A thousand the day
after we get ashore&mdash;prompt.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t wait till
she breaks up, Mr. Cloete.&nbsp; To the underwriters I go if
I&rsquo;ve to walk to London on my bare feet.&nbsp; Port
cable!&nbsp; Look at her port cable, I will say to them.&nbsp; I
doctored it&mdash;for the owners&mdash;tempted by a low rascal
called Cloete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloete does not understand what it means exactly.&nbsp;
All he sees is that the fellow means to make mischief.&nbsp; He
sees trouble ahead. . . Do you think you can scare me? he
asks,&mdash;you poor miserable skunk. . . And Stafford faces him
out&mdash;both holding on to the cabin table: No, damn you, you
are only a dirty vagabond; but I can scare the other, the chap in
the black coat. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning George Dunbar.&nbsp; Cloete&rsquo;s brain reels
at the thought.&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t imagine the fellow can do
any real harm, but he knows what George is; give the show away;
upset the whole business he had set his heart on.&nbsp; He says
nothing; he hears the other, what with the funk and strain and
excitement, panting like a dog&mdash;and then a snarl. . . A
thousand down, twenty-four hours after we get ashore; day after
to-morrow.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my last word, Mr. Cloete. . . A
thousand pounds, day after to-morrow, says Cloete.&nbsp; Oh
yes.&nbsp; And to-day take this, you dirty cur. . . He hits
straight from the shoulder in sheer rage, nothing else.&nbsp;
Stafford goes away spinning along the bulk-head.&nbsp; Seeing
this, Cloete steps out and lands him another one somewhere about
the jaw.&nbsp; The fellow staggers backward right into the
captain&rsquo;s cabin through the open door.&nbsp; Cloete,
following him up, hears him fall down heavily and roll to
leeward, then slams the door to and turns the key. . . There!
says he to himself, that will stop you from making
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; I murmured.</p>
<p>The old fellow departed from his impressive immobility to turn
his rakishly hatted head and look at me with his old, black,
lack-lustre eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did leave him there,&rdquo; he uttered, weightily,
returning to the contemplation of the wall.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cloete
didn&rsquo;t mean to allow anybody, let alone a thing like
Stafford, to stand in the way of his great notion of making
George and himself, and Captain Harry, too, for that matter, rich
men.&nbsp; And he didn&rsquo;t think much of consequences.&nbsp;
These patent-medicine chaps don&rsquo;t care what they say or
what they do.&nbsp; They think the world&rsquo;s bound to swallow
any story they like to tell. . . He stands listening for a
bit.&nbsp; And it gives him quite a turn to hear a thump at the
door and a sort of muffled raving screech inside the
captain&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; He thinks he hears his own name, too,
through the awful crash as the old <i>Sagamore</i> rises and
falls to a sea.&nbsp; That noise and that awful shock make him
clear out of the cabin.&nbsp; He collects his senses on the
poop.&nbsp; But his heart sinks a little at the black wildness of
the night.&nbsp; Chances that he will get drowned himself before
long.&nbsp; Puts his head down the companion.&nbsp; Through the
wind and breaking seas he can hear the noise of Stafford&rsquo;s
beating against the door and cursing.&nbsp; He listens and says
to himself: No.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t trust him now. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he gets back to the top of the deck-house he says
to Captain Harry, who asks him if he got the things, that he is
very sorry.&nbsp; There was something wrong with the door.&nbsp;
Couldn&rsquo;t open it.&nbsp; And to tell you the truth, says he,
I didn&rsquo;t like to stop any longer in that cabin.&nbsp; There
are noises there as if the ship were going to pieces. . . Captain
Harry thinks: Nervous; can&rsquo;t be anything wrong with the
door.&nbsp; But he says: Thanks&mdash;never mind, never mind. . .
All hands looking out now for the life-boat.&nbsp; Everybody
thinking of himself rather.&nbsp; Cloete asks himself, will they
miss him?&nbsp; But the fact is that Mr. Stafford had made such
poor show at sea that after the ship struck nobody ever paid any
attention to him.&nbsp; Nobody cared what he did or where he
was.&nbsp; Pitch dark, too&mdash;no counting of heads.&nbsp; The
light of the tug with the lifeboat in tow is seen making for the
ship, and Captain Harry asks: Are we all there? . . . Somebody
answers: All here, sir. . . Stand by to leave the ship, then,
says Captain Harry; and two of you help the gentleman over first.
. . Aye, aye, sir. . . Cloete was moved to ask Captain Harry to
let him stay till last, but the life-boat drops on a grapnel
abreast the fore-rigging, two chaps lay hold of him, watch their
chance, and drop him into her, all safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s nearly exhausted; not used to that sort of
thing, you see.&nbsp; He sits in the stern-sheets with his eyes
shut.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t want to look at the white water boiling
all around.&nbsp; The men drop into the boat one after
another.&nbsp; Then he hears Captain Harry&rsquo;s voice shouting
in the wind to the coxswain, to hold on a moment, and some other
words he can&rsquo;t catch, and the coxswain yelling back:
Don&rsquo;t be long, sir. . . What is it?&nbsp; Cloete asks
feeling faint. . . Something about the ship&rsquo;s papers, says
the coxswain, very anxious.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no time to be
fooling about alongside, you understand.&nbsp; They haul the boat
off a little and wait.&nbsp; The water flies over her in
sheets.&nbsp; Cloete&rsquo;s senses almost leave him.&nbsp; He
thinks of nothing.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s numb all over, till
there&rsquo;s a shout: Here he is! . . . They see a figure in the
fore-rigging waiting&mdash;they slack away on the grapnel-line
and get him in the boat quite easy.&nbsp; There is a little
shouting&mdash;it&rsquo;s all mixed up with the noise of the
sea.&nbsp; Cloete fancies that Stafford&rsquo;s voice is talking
away quite close to his ear.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a lull in the
wind, and Stafford&rsquo;s voice seems to be speaking very fast
to the coxswain; he tells him that of course he was near his
skipper, was all the time near him, till the old man said at the
last moment that he must go and get the ship&rsquo;s papers from
aft; would insist on going himself; told him, Stafford, to get
into the life-boat. . . He had meant to wait for his skipper,
only there came this smooth of the seas, and he thought he would
take his chance at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloete opens his eyes.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
Stafford sitting close by him in that crowded life-boat.&nbsp;
The coxswain stoops over Cloete and cries: Did you hear what the
mate said, sir? . . . Cloete&rsquo;s face feels as if it were set
in plaster, lips and all.&nbsp; Yes, I did, he forces himself to
answer.&nbsp; The coxswain waits a moment, then says: I
don&rsquo;t like it. . . And he turns to the mate, telling him it
was a pity he did not try to run along the deck and hurry up the
captain when the lull came.&nbsp; Stafford answers at once that
he did think of it, only he was afraid of missing him on the deck
in the dark.&nbsp; For, says he, the captain might have got over
at once, thinking I was already in the life-boat, and you would
have hauled off perhaps, leaving me behind. . . True enough, says
the coxswain.&nbsp; A minute or so passes.&nbsp; This won&rsquo;t
do, mutters the coxswain.&nbsp; Suddenly Stafford speaks up in a
sort of hollow voice: I was by when he told Mr. Cloete here that
he didn&rsquo;t know how he would ever have the courage to leave
the old ship; didn&rsquo;t he, now? . . . And Cloete feels his
arm being gripped quietly in the dark. . . Didn&rsquo;t he
now?&nbsp; We were standing together just before you went over,
Mr. Cloete? . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just then the coxswain cries out: I&rsquo;m going on
board to see. . . Cloete tears his arm away: I am going with you.
. .</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they get aboard, the coxswain tells Cloete to go
aft along one side of the ship and he would go along the other so
as not to miss the captain. . . And feel about with your hands,
too, says he; he might have fallen and be lying insensible
somewhere on the deck. . . When Cloete gets at last to the cabin
companion on the poop the coxswain is already there, peering down
and sniffing.&nbsp; I detect a smell of smoke down there, says
he.&nbsp; And he yells: Are you there, sir? . . . This is not a
case for shouting, says Cloete, feeling his heart go stony, as it
were. . . Down they go.&nbsp; Pitch dark; the inclination so
sharp that the coxswain, groping his way into the captain&rsquo;s
room, slips and goes tumbling down.&nbsp; Cloete hears him cry
out as though he had hurt himself, and asks what&rsquo;s the
matter.&nbsp; And the coxswain answers quietly that he had fallen
on the captain, lying there insensible.&nbsp; Cloete without a
word begins to grope all over the shelves for a box of matches,
finds one, and strikes a light.&nbsp; He sees the coxswain in his
cork jacket kneeling over Captain Harry. . . Blood, says the
coxswain, looking up, and the match goes out. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit, says Cloete; I&rsquo;ll make paper spills.
. . He had felt the back of books on the shelves.&nbsp; And so he
stands lighting one spill from another while the coxswain turns
poor Captain Harry over.&nbsp; Dead, he says.&nbsp; Shot through
the heart.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the revolver. . . He hands it up to
Cloete, who looks at it before putting it in his pocket, and sees
a plate on the butt with <i>H. Dunbar</i> on it. . . His own, he
mutters. . . Whose else revolver did you expect to find? snaps
the coxswain.&nbsp; And look, he took off his long oilskin in the
cabin before he went in.&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s this lot of burnt
paper?&nbsp; What could he want to burn the ship&rsquo;s papers
for? . . .</p>
<p>Cloete sees all, the little drawers drawn out, and asks the
coxswain to look well into them. . . There&rsquo;s nothing, says
the man.&nbsp; Cleaned out.&nbsp; Seems to have pulled out all he
could lay his hands on and set fire to the lot.&nbsp;
Mad&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it is&mdash;went mad.&nbsp; And now
he&rsquo;s dead.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have to break it to his wife.
. .</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel as if I were going mad myself, says Cloete,
suddenly, and the coxswain begs him for God&rsquo;s sake to pull
himself together, and drags him away from the cabin.&nbsp; They
had to leave the body, and as it was they were just in time
before a furious squall came on.&nbsp; Cloete is dragged into the
life-boat and the coxswain tumbles in.&nbsp; Haul away on the
grapnel, he shouts; the captain has shot himself. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloete was like a dead man&mdash;didn&rsquo;t care for
anything.&nbsp; He let that Stafford pinch his arm twice without
making a sign.&nbsp; Most of Westport was on the old pier to see
the men out of the life-boat, and at first there was a sort of
confused cheery uproar when she came alongside; but after the
coxswain has shouted something the voices die out, and everybody
is very quiet.&nbsp; As soon as Cloete has set foot on something
firm he becomes himself again.&nbsp; The coxswain shakes hands
with him: Poor woman, poor woman, I&rsquo;d rather you had the
job than I. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the mate?&rdquo; asks Cloete.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s the last man who spoke to the master. . . Somebody ran
along&mdash;the crew were being taken to the Mission Hall, where
there was a fire and shake-downs ready for them&mdash;somebody
ran along the pier and caught up with Stafford. . . Here!&nbsp;
The owner&rsquo;s agent wants you. . . Cloete tucks the
fellow&rsquo;s arm under his own and walks away with him to the
left, where the fishing-harbour is. . . I suppose I haven&rsquo;t
misunderstood you.&nbsp; You wish me to look after you a bit,
says he.&nbsp; The other hangs on him rather limp, but gives a
nasty little laugh: You had better, he mumbles; but mind, no
tricks; no tricks, Mr. Cloete; we are on land now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a police office within fifty yards from
here, says Cloete.&nbsp; He turns into a little public house,
pushes Stafford along the passage.&nbsp; The landlord runs out of
the bar. . . This is the mate of the ship on the rocks, Cloete
explains; I wish you would take care of him a bit to-night. . .
What&rsquo;s the matter with him? asks the man.&nbsp; Stafford
leans against the wall in the passage, looking ghastly.&nbsp; And
Cloete says it&rsquo;s nothing&mdash;done up, of course. . . I
will be responsible for the expense; I am the owner&rsquo;s
agent.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be round in an hour or two to see
him.</p>
<p>And Cloete gets back to the hotel.&nbsp; The news had
travelled there already, and the first thing he sees is George
outside the door as white as a sheet waiting for him.&nbsp;
Cloete just gives him a nod and they go in.&nbsp; Mrs. Harry
stands at the head of the stairs, and, when she sees only these
two coming up, flings her arms above her head and runs into her
room.&nbsp; Nobody had dared tell her, but not seeing her husband
was enough.&nbsp; Cloete hears an awful shriek. . . Go to her, he
says to George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While he&rsquo;s alone in the private parlour Cloete
drinks a glass of brandy and thinks it all out.&nbsp; Then George
comes in. . . The landlady&rsquo;s with her, he says.&nbsp; And
he begins to walk up and down the room, flinging his arms about
and talking, disconnected like, his face set hard as Cloete has
never seen it before. . . What must be, must be.&nbsp;
Dead&mdash;only brother.&nbsp; Well, dead&mdash;his troubles
over.&nbsp; But we are living, he says to Cloete; and I suppose,
says he, glaring at him with hot, dry eyes, that you won&rsquo;t
forget to wire in the morning to your friend that we are coming
in for certain. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning the patent-medicine fellow. . . Death is death
and business is business, George goes on; and look&mdash;my hands
are clean, he says, showing them to Cloete.&nbsp; Cloete thinks:
He&rsquo;s going crazy.&nbsp; He catches hold of him by the
shoulders and begins to shake him: Damn you&mdash;if you had had
the sense to know what to say to your brother, if you had had the
spunk to speak to him at all, you moral creature you, he would be
alive now, he shouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this George stares, then bursts out weeping with a
great bellow.&nbsp; He throws himself on the couch, buries his
face in a cushion, and howls like a kid. . . That&rsquo;s better,
thinks Cloete, and he leaves him, telling the landlord that he
must go out, as he has some little business to attend to that
night.&nbsp; The landlord&rsquo;s wife, weeping herself, catches
him on the stairs: Oh, sir, that poor lady will go out of her
mind. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloete shakes her off, thinking to himself: Oh
no!&nbsp; She won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She will get over it.&nbsp;
Nobody will go mad about this affair unless I do.&nbsp; It
isn&rsquo;t sorrow that makes people go mad, but worry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There Cloete was wrong.&nbsp; What affected Mrs. Harry
was that her husband should take his own life, with her, as it
were, looking on.&nbsp; She brooded over it so that in less than
a year they had to put her into a Home.&nbsp; She was very, very
quiet; just gentle melancholy.&nbsp; She lived for quite a long
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Cloete splashes along in the wind and rain.&nbsp;
Nobody in the streets&mdash;all the excitement over.&nbsp; The
publican runs out to meet him in the passage and says to him: Not
this way.&nbsp; He isn&rsquo;t in his room.&nbsp; We
couldn&rsquo;t get him to go to bed nohow.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s in
the little parlour there.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve lighted him a fire. .
. You have been giving him drinks too, says Cloete; I never said
I would be responsible for drinks.&nbsp; How many? . . . Two,
says the other.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
mind doing that much for a shipwrecked sailor. . . Cloete smiles
his funny smile: Eh?&nbsp; Come.&nbsp; He paid for them. . . The
publican just blinks. . . Gave you gold, didn&rsquo;t he?&nbsp;
Speak up! . . . What of that! cries the man.&nbsp; What are you
after, anyway?&nbsp; He had the right change for his
sovereign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so, says Cloete.&nbsp; He walks into the parlour,
and there he sees our Stafford; hair all up on end,
landlord&rsquo;s shirt and pants on, bare feet in slippers,
sitting by the fire.&nbsp; When he sees Cloete he casts his eyes
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mean us ever to meet again, Mr.
Cloete, Stafford says, demurely. . . That fellow, when he had the
drink he wanted&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t a drunkard&mdash;would put
on this sort of sly, modest air. . . But since the captain
committed suicide, he says, I have been sitting here thinking it
out.&nbsp; All sorts of things happen.&nbsp; Conspiracy to lose
the ship&mdash;attempted murder&mdash;and this suicide.&nbsp; For
if it was not suicide, Mr. Cloete, then I know of a victim of the
most cruel, cold-blooded attempt at murder; somebody who has
suffered a thousand deaths.&nbsp; And that makes the thousand
pounds of which we spoke once a quite insignificant sum.&nbsp;
Look how very convenient this suicide is. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks up at Cloete then, who smiles at him and comes
quite close to the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You killed Harry Dunbar, he whispers. . . The fellow
glares at him and shows his teeth: Of course I did!&nbsp; I had
been in that cabin for an hour and a half like a rat in a trap. .
. Shut up and left to drown in that wreck.&nbsp; Let flesh and
blood judge.&nbsp; Of course I shot him!&nbsp; I thought it was
you, you murdering scoundrel, come back to settle me.&nbsp; He
opens the door flying and tumbles right down upon me; I had a
revolver in my hand, and I shot him.&nbsp; I was crazy.&nbsp; Men
have gone crazy for less.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloete looks at him without flinching.&nbsp; Aha!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s your story, is it? . . . And he shakes the table a
little in his passion as he speaks. . . Now listen to mine.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s this conspiracy?&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s going to prove
it?&nbsp; You were there to rob.&nbsp; You were rifling his
cabin; he came upon you unawares with your hands in the drawer;
and you shot him with his own revolver.&nbsp; You killed to
steal&mdash;to steal!&nbsp; His brother and the clerks in the
office know that he took sixty pounds with him to sea.&nbsp;
Sixty pounds in gold in a canvas bag.&nbsp; He told me where they
were.&nbsp; The coxswain of the life-boat can swear to it that
the drawers were all empty.&nbsp; And you are such a fool that
before you&rsquo;re half an hour ashore you change a sovereign to
pay for a drink.&nbsp; Listen to me.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t
turn up day after to-morrow at George Dunbar&rsquo;s solicitors,
to make the proper deposition as to the loss of the ship, I shall
set the police on your track.&nbsp; Day after to-morrow. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then what do you think?&nbsp; That Stafford begins
to tear his hair.&nbsp; Just so.&nbsp; Tugs at it with both hands
without saying anything.&nbsp; Cloete gives a push to the table
which nearly sends the fellow off his chair, tumbling inside the
fender; so that he has got to catch hold of it to save himself. .
.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the sort of man I am, Cloete says,
fiercely.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got to a point that I don&rsquo;t care
what happens to me.&nbsp; I would shoot you now for tuppence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this the cur dodges under the table.&nbsp; Then
Cloete goes out, and as he turns in the street&mdash;you know,
little fishermen&rsquo;s cottages, all dark; raining in torrents,
too&mdash;the other opens the window of the parlour and speaks in
a sort of crying voice&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You low Yankee fiend&mdash;I&rsquo;ll pay you off some
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloete passes by with a damn bitter laugh, because he
thinks that the fellow in a way has paid him off already, if he
only knew it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>My impressive ruffian drank what remained of his beer, while
his black, sunken eyes looked at me over the rim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand this,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He unbent a little and explained without too much scorn that
Captain Harry being dead, his half of the insurance money went to
his wife, and her trustees of course bought consols with
it.&nbsp; Enough to keep her comfortable.&nbsp; George
Dunbar&rsquo;s half, as Cloete feared from the first, did not
prove sufficient to launch the medicine well; other moneyed men
stepped in, and these two had to go out of that business, pretty
nearly shorn of everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am curious,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to learn what the
motive force of this tragic affair was&mdash;I mean the patent
medicine.&nbsp; Do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He named it, and I whistled respectfully.&nbsp; Nothing less
than Parker&rsquo;s Lively Lumbago Pills.&nbsp; Enormous
property!&nbsp; You know it; all the world knows it.&nbsp; Every
second man, at least, on this globe of ours has tried it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;they missed an immense
fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he mumbled, &ldquo;by the price of a
revolver-shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told me also that eventually Cloete returned to the States,
passenger in a cargo-boat from Albert Dock.&nbsp; The night
before he sailed he met him wandering about the quays, and took
him home for a drink.&nbsp; &ldquo;Funny chap, Cloete.&nbsp; We
sat all night drinking grogs, till it was time for him to go on
board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was then that Cloete, unembittered but weary, told him this
story, with that utterly unconscious frankness of a
patent-medicine man stranger to all moral standards.&nbsp; Cloete
concluded by remarking that he, had &ldquo;had enough of the old
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; George Dunbar had turned on him, too, in
the end.&nbsp; Cloete was clearly somewhat disillusioned.</p>
<p>As to Stafford, he died, professed loafer, in some East End
hospital or other, and on his last day clamoured &ldquo;for a
parson,&rdquo; because his conscience worried him for killing an
innocent man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wanted somebody to tell him it was all
right,&rdquo; growled my old ruffian, contemptuously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He told the parson that I knew this Cloete who had tried
to murder him, and so the parson (he worked among the dock
labourers) once spoke to me about it.&nbsp; That skunk of a
fellow finding himself trapped yelled for mercy. . . Promised to
be good and so on. . . Then he went crazy . . . screamed and
threw himself about, beat his head against the bulkheads . . .
you can guess all that&mdash;eh? . . . till he was
exhausted.&nbsp; Gave up.&nbsp; Threw himself down, shut his
eyes, and wanted to pray.&nbsp; So he says.&nbsp; Tried to think
of some prayer for a quick death&mdash;he was that
terrified.&nbsp; Thought that if he had a knife or something he
would cut his throat, and be done with it.&nbsp; Then he thinks:
No!&nbsp; Would try to cut away the wood about the lock. . . He
had no knife in his pocket. . . he was weeping and calling on God
to send him a tool of some kind when suddenly he thinks:
Axe!&nbsp; In most ships there is a spare emergency axe kept in
the master&rsquo;s room in some locker or other. . . Up he jumps.
. . Pitch dark.&nbsp; Pulls at the drawers to find matches and,
groping for them, the first thing he comes upon&mdash;Captain
Harry&rsquo;s revolver.&nbsp; Loaded too.&nbsp; He goes perfectly
quiet all over.&nbsp; Can shoot the lock to pieces.&nbsp;
See?&nbsp; Saved!&nbsp; God&rsquo;s providence!&nbsp; There are
boxes of matches too.&nbsp; Thinks he: I may just as well see
what I am about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strikes a light and sees the little canvas bag tucked
away at the back of the drawer.&nbsp; Knew at once what that
was.&nbsp; Rams it into his pocket quick.&nbsp; Aha! says he to
himself: this requires more light.&nbsp; So he pitches a lot of
paper on the floor, set fire to it, and starts in a hurry
rummaging for more valuables.&nbsp; Did you ever?&nbsp; He told
that East-End parson that the devil tempted him.&nbsp; First
God&rsquo;s mercy&mdash;then devil&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; Turn and
turn about. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any squirming skunk can talk like that.&nbsp; He was so
busy with the drawers that the first thing he heard was a shout,
Great Heavens.&nbsp; He looks up and there was the door open
(Cloete had left the key in the lock) and Captain Harry holding
on, well above him, very fierce in the light of the burning
papers.&nbsp; His eyes were starting out of his head.&nbsp;
Thieving, he thunders at him.&nbsp; A sailor!&nbsp; An
officer!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; A wretch like you deserves no better
than to be left here to drown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Stafford&mdash;on his death-bed&mdash;told the
parson that when he heard these words he went crazy again.&nbsp;
He snatched his hand with the revolver in it out of the drawer,
and fired without aiming.&nbsp; Captain Harry fell right in with
a crash like a stone on top of the burning papers, putting the
blaze out.&nbsp; All dark.&nbsp; Not a sound.&nbsp; He listened
for a bit then dropped the revolver and scrambled out on deck
like mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old fellow struck the table with his ponderous fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes me sick is to hear these silly boat-men
telling people the captain committed suicide.&nbsp; Pah!&nbsp;
Captain Harry was a man that could face his Maker any time up
there, and here below, too.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t the sort to
slink out of life.&nbsp; Not he!&nbsp; He was a good man down to
the ground.&nbsp; He gave me my first job as stevedore only three
days after I got married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the vindication of Captain Harry from the charge of suicide
seemed to be his only object, I did not thank him very effusively
for his material.&nbsp; And then it was not worth many thanks in
any case.</p>
<p>For it is too startling even to think of such things happening
in our respectable Channel in full view, so to speak, of the
luxurious continental traffic to Switzerland and Monte
Carlo.&nbsp; This story to be acceptable should have been
transposed to somewhere in the South Seas.&nbsp; But it would
have been too much trouble to cook it for the consumption of
magazine readers.&nbsp; So here it is raw, so to speak&mdash;just
as it was told to me&mdash;but unfortunately robbed of the
striking effect of the narrator; the most imposing old ruffian
that ever followed the unromantic trade of master stevedore in
the port of London.</p>

<h2><!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>THE INN OF THE TWO WITCHES<br />
<span class="smcap">a find</span></h2>
<p>This tale, episode, experience&mdash;call it how you
will&mdash;was related in the fifties of the last century by a
man who, by his own confession, was sixty years old at the
time.&nbsp; Sixty is not a bad age&mdash;unless in perspective,
when no doubt it is contemplated by the majority of us with mixed
feelings.&nbsp; It is a calm age; the game is practically over by
then; and standing aside one begins to remember with a certain
vividness what a fine fellow one used to be.&nbsp; I have
observed that, by an amiable attention of Providence, most people
at sixty begin to take a romantic view of themselves.&nbsp; Their
very failures exhale a charm of peculiar potency.&nbsp; And
indeed the hopes of the future are a fine company to live with,
exquisite forms, fascinating if you like, but&mdash;so to
speak&mdash;naked, stripped for a run.&nbsp; The robes of glamour
are luckily the property of the immovable past which, without
them, would sit, a shivery sort of thing, under the gathering
shadows.</p>
<p>I suppose it was the romanticism of growing age which set our
man to relate his experience for his own satisfaction or for the
wonder of his posterity.&nbsp; It could not have been for his
glory, because the experience was simply that of an abominable
fright&mdash;terror he calls it.&nbsp; You would have guessed
that the relation alluded to in the very first lines was in
writing.</p>
<p>This writing constitutes the Find declared in the
sub-title.&nbsp; The title itself is my own contrivance,
(can&rsquo;t call it invention), and has the merit of
veracity.&nbsp; We will be concerned with an inn here.&nbsp; As
to the witches that&rsquo;s merely a conventional expression, and
we must take our man&rsquo;s word for it that it fits the
case.</p>
<p>The Find was made in a box of books bought in London, in a
street which no longer exists, from a second-hand bookseller in
the last stage of decay.&nbsp; As to the books themselves they
were at least twentieth-hand, and on inspection turned out not
worth the very small sum of money I disbursed.&nbsp; It might
have been some premonition of that fact which made me say:
&ldquo;But I must have the box too.&rdquo;&nbsp; The decayed
bookseller assented by the careless, tragic gesture of a man
already doomed to extinction.</p>
<p>A litter of loose pages at the bottom of the box excited my
curiosity but faintly.&nbsp; The close, neat, regular handwriting
was not attractive at first sight.&nbsp; But in one place the
statement that in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1813 the writer
was twenty-two years old caught my eye.&nbsp; Two and twenty is
an interesting age in which one is easily reckless and easily
frightened; the faculty of reflection being weak and the power of
imagination strong.</p>
<p>In another place the phrase: &ldquo;At night we stood in
again,&rdquo; arrested my languid attention, because it was a sea
phrase.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what it is all about,&rdquo;
I thought, without excitement.</p>
<p>Oh! but it was a dull-faced MS., each line resembling every
other line in their close-set and regular order.&nbsp; It was
like the drone of a monotonous voice.&nbsp; A treatise on
sugar-refining (the dreariest subject I can think of) could have
been given a more lively appearance.&nbsp; &ldquo;In <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1813, I was twenty-two years
old,&rdquo; he begins earnestly and goes on with every appearance
of calm, horrible industry.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t imagine, however,
that there is anything archaic in my find.&nbsp; Diabolic
ingenuity in invention though as old as the world is by no means
a lost art.&nbsp; Look at the telephones for shattering the
little peace of mind given to us in this world, or at the machine
guns for letting with dispatch life out of our bodies.&nbsp;
Now-a-days any blear-eyed old witch if only strong enough to turn
an insignificant little handle could lay low a hundred young men
of twenty in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>If this isn&rsquo;t progress! . . . Why immense!&nbsp; We have
moved on, and so you must expect to meet here a certain naiveness
of contrivance and simplicity of aim appertaining to the remote
epoch.&nbsp; And of course no motoring tourist can hope to find
such an inn anywhere, now.&nbsp; This one, the one of the title,
was situated in Spain.&nbsp; That much I discovered only from
internal evidence, because a good many pages of that relation
were missing&mdash;perhaps not a great misfortune after
all.&nbsp; The writer seemed to have entered into a most
elaborate detail of the why and wherefore of his presence on that
coast&mdash;presumably the north coast of Spain.&nbsp; His
experience has nothing to do with the sea, though.&nbsp; As far
as I can make it out, he was an officer on board a
sloop-of-war.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing strange in that.&nbsp;
At all stages of the long Peninsular campaign many of our
men-of-war of the smaller kind were cruising off the north coast
of Spain&mdash;as risky and disagreeable a station as can be well
imagined.</p>
<p>It looks as though that ship of his had had some special
service to perform.&nbsp; A careful explanation of all the
circumstances was to be expected from our man, only, as
I&rsquo;ve said, some of his pages (good tough paper too) were
missing: gone in covers for jampots or in wadding for the
fowling-pieces of his irreverent posterity.&nbsp; But it is to be
seen clearly that communication with the shore and even the
sending of messengers inland was part of her service, either to
obtain intelligence from or to transmit orders or advice to
patriotic Spaniards, guerilleros or secret juntas of the
province.&nbsp; Something of the sort.&nbsp; All this can be only
inferred from the preserved scraps of his conscientious
writing.</p>
<p>Next we come upon the panegyric of a very fine sailor, a
member of the ship&rsquo;s company, having the rating of the
captain&rsquo;s coxswain.&nbsp; He was known on board as Cuba
Tom; not because he was Cuban however; he was indeed the best
type of a genuine British tar of that time, and a
man-of-war&rsquo;s man for years.&nbsp; He came by the name on
account of some wonderful adventures he had in that island in his
young days, adventures which were the favourite subject of the
yarns he was in the habit of spinning to his shipmates of an
evening on the forecastle head.&nbsp; He was intelligent, very
strong, and of proved courage.&nbsp; Incidentally we are told, so
exact is our narrator, that Tom had the finest pigtail for
thickness and length of any man in the Navy.&nbsp; This
appendage, much cared for and sheathed tightly in a porpoise
skin, hung half way down his broad back to the great admiration
of all beholders and to the great envy of some.</p>
<p>Our young officer dwells on the manly qualities of Cuba Tom
with something like affection.&nbsp; This sort of relation
between officer and man was not then very rare.&nbsp; A youngster
on joining the service was put under the charge of a trustworthy
seaman, who slung his first hammock for him and often later on
became a sort of humble friend to the junior officer.&nbsp; The
narrator on joining the sloop had found this man on board after
some years of separation.&nbsp; There is something touching in
the warm pleasure he remembers and records at this meeting with
the professional mentor of his boyhood.</p>
<p>We discover then that, no Spaniard being forthcoming for the
service, this worthy seaman with the unique pigtail and a very
high character for courage and steadiness had been selected as
messenger for one of these missions inland which have been
mentioned.&nbsp; His preparations were not elaborate.&nbsp; One
gloomy autumn morning the sloop ran close to a shallow cove where
a landing could be made on that iron-bound shore.&nbsp; A boat
was lowered, and pulled in with Tom Corbin (Cuba Tom) perched in
the bow, and our young man (Mr. Edgar Byrne was his name on this
earth which knows him no more) sitting in the stern sheets.</p>
<p>A few inhabitants of a hamlet, whose grey stone houses could
be seen a hundred yards or so up a deep ravine, had come down to
the shore and watched the approach of the boat.&nbsp; The two
Englishmen leaped ashore.&nbsp; Either from dullness or
astonishment the peasants gave no greeting, and only fell back in
silence.</p>
<p>Mr. Byrne had made up his mind to see Tom Corbin started
fairly on his way.&nbsp; He looked round at the heavy surprised
faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much to get out of them,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us walk up to the village.&nbsp; There
will be a wine shop for sure where we may find somebody more
promising to talk to and get some information from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir,&rdquo; said Tom falling into step behind
his officer.&nbsp; &ldquo;A bit of palaver as to courses and
distances can do no harm; I crossed the broadest part of Cuba by
the help of my tongue tho&rsquo; knowing far less Spanish than I
do now.&nbsp; As they say themselves it was &lsquo;four words and
no more&rsquo; with me, that time when I got left behind on shore
by the <i>Blanche</i>, frigate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made light of what was before him, which was but a
day&rsquo;s journey into the mountains.&nbsp; It is true that
there was a full day&rsquo;s journey before striking the mountain
path, but that was nothing for a man who had crossed the island
of Cuba on his two legs, and with no more than four words of the
language to begin with.</p>
<p>The officer and the man were walking now on a thick sodden bed
of dead leaves, which the peasants thereabouts accumulate in the
streets of their villages to rot during the winter for field
manure.&nbsp; Turning his head Mr. Byrne perceived that the whole
male population of the hamlet was following them on the noiseless
springy carpet.&nbsp; Women stared from the doors of the houses
and the children had apparently gone into hiding.&nbsp; The
village knew the ship by sight, afar off, but no stranger had
landed on that spot perhaps for a hundred years or more.&nbsp;
The cocked hat of Mr. Byrne, the bushy whiskers and the enormous
pigtail of the sailor, filled them with mute wonder.&nbsp; They
pressed behind the two Englishmen staring like those islanders
discovered by Captain Cook in the South Seas.</p>
<p>It was then that Byrne had his first glimpse of the little
cloaked man in a yellow hat.&nbsp; Faded and dingy as it was,
this covering for his head made him noticeable.</p>
<p>The entrance to the wine shop was like a rough hole in a wall
of flints.&nbsp; The owner was the only person who was not in the
street, for he came out from the darkness at the back where the
inflated forms of wine skins hung on nails could be vaguely
distinguished.&nbsp; He was a tall, one-eyed Asturian with
scrubby, hollow cheeks; a grave expression of countenance
contrasted enigmatically with the roaming restlessness of his
solitary eye.&nbsp; On learning that the matter in hand was the
sending on his way of that English mariner toward a certain
Gonzales in the mountains, he closed his good eye for a moment as
if in meditation.&nbsp; Then opened it, very lively again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly, possibly.&nbsp; It could be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A friendly murmur arose in the group in the doorway at the
name of Gonzales, the local leader against the French.&nbsp;
Inquiring as to the safety of the road Byrne was glad to learn
that no troops of that nation had been seen in the neighbourhood
for months.&nbsp; Not the smallest little detachment of these
impious <i>polizones</i>.&nbsp; While giving these answers the
owner of the wine-shop busied himself in drawing into an
earthenware jug some wine which he set before the heretic
English, pocketing with grave abstraction the small piece of
money the officer threw upon the table in recognition of the
unwritten law that none may enter a wine-shop without buying
drink.&nbsp; His eye was in constant motion as if it were trying
to do the work of the two; but when Byrne made inquiries as to
the possibility of hiring a mule, it became immovably fixed in
the direction of the door which was closely besieged by the
curious.&nbsp; In front of them, just within the threshold, the
little man in the large cloak and yellow hat had taken his
stand.&nbsp; He was a diminutive person, a mere homunculus, Byrne
describes him, in a ridiculously mysterious, yet assertive
attitude, a corner of his cloak thrown cavalierly over his left
shoulder, muffling his chin and mouth; while the broad-brimmed
yellow hat hung on a corner of his square little head.&nbsp; He
stood there taking snuff, repeatedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mule,&rdquo; repeated the wine-seller, his eyes fixed
on that quaint and snuffy figure. . . &ldquo;No, se&ntilde;or
officer!&nbsp; Decidedly no mule is to be got in this poor
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coxswain, who stood by with the true sailor&rsquo;s air of
unconcern in strange surroundings, struck in quietly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your honour will believe me Shank&rsquo;s
pony&rsquo;s the best for this job.&nbsp; I would have to leave
the beast somewhere, anyhow, since the captain has told me that
half my way will be along paths fit only for goats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The diminutive man made a step forward, and speaking through
the folds of the cloak which seemed to muffle a sarcastic
intention&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Si, se&ntilde;or.&nbsp; They are too honest in this
village to have a single mule amongst them for your
worship&rsquo;s service.&nbsp; To that I can bear
testimony.&nbsp; In these times it&rsquo;s only rogues or very
clever men who can manage to have mules or any other four-footed
beasts and the wherewithal to keep them.&nbsp; But what this
valiant mariner wants is a guide; and here, se&ntilde;or, behold
my brother-in-law, Bernardino, wine-seller, and alcade of this
most Christian and hospitable village, who will find you
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, Mr. Byrne says in his relation, was the only thing to
do.&nbsp; A youth in a ragged coat and goat-skin breeches was
produced after some more talk.&nbsp; The English officer stood
treat to the whole village, and while the peasants drank he and
Cuba Tom took their departure accompanied by the guide.&nbsp; The
diminutive man in the cloak had disappeared.</p>
<p>Byrne went along with the coxswain out of the village.&nbsp;
He wanted to see him fairly on his way; and he would have gone a
greater distance, if the seaman had not suggested respectfully
the advisability of return so as not to keep the ship a moment
longer than necessary so close in with the shore on such an
unpromising looking morning.&nbsp; A wild gloomy sky hung over
their heads when they took leave of each other, and their
surroundings of rank bushes and stony fields were dreary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In four days&rsquo; time,&rdquo; were Byrne&rsquo;s
last words, &ldquo;the ship will stand in and send a boat on
shore if the weather permits.&nbsp; If not you&rsquo;ll have to
make it out on shore the best you can till we come along to take
you off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, sir,&rdquo; answered Tom, and strode
on.&nbsp; Byrne watched him step out on a narrow path.&nbsp; In a
thick pea-jacket with a pair of pistols in his belt, a cutlass by
his side, and a stout cudgel in his hand, he looked a sturdy
figure and well able to take care of himself.&nbsp; He turned
round for a moment to wave his hand, giving to Byrne one more
view of his honest bronzed face with bushy whiskers.&nbsp; The
lad in goatskin breeches looking, Byrne says, like a faun or a
young satyr leaping ahead, stopped to wait for him, and then went
off at a bound.&nbsp; Both disappeared.</p>
<p>Byrne turned back.&nbsp; The hamlet was hidden in a fold of
the ground, and the spot seemed the most lonely corner of the
earth and as if accursed in its uninhabited desolate
barrenness.&nbsp; Before he had walked many yards, there appeared
very suddenly from behind a bush the muffled up diminutive
Spaniard.&nbsp; Naturally Byrne stopped short.</p>
<p>The other made a mysterious gesture with a tiny hand peeping
from under his cloak.&nbsp; His hat hung very much at the side of
his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he said without any
preliminaries.&nbsp; &ldquo;Caution!&nbsp; It is a positive fact
that one-eyed Bernardino, my brother-in-law, has at this moment a
mule in his stable.&nbsp; And why he who is not clever has a mule
there?&nbsp; Because he is a rogue; a man without
conscience.&nbsp; Because I had to give up the <i>macho</i> to
him to secure for myself a roof to sleep under and a mouthful of
<i>olla</i> to keep my soul in this insignificant body of
mine.&nbsp; Yet, se&ntilde;or, it contains a heart many times
bigger than the mean thing which beats in the breast of that
brute connection of mine of which I am ashamed, though I opposed
that marriage with all my power.&nbsp; Well, the misguided woman
suffered enough.&nbsp; She had her purgatory on this
earth&mdash;God rest her soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Byrne says he was so astonished by the sudden appearance of
that sprite-like being, and by the sardonic bitterness of the
speech, that he was unable to disentangle the significant fact
from what seemed but a piece of family history fired out at him
without rhyme or reason.&nbsp; Not at first.&nbsp; He was
confounded and at the same time he was impressed by the rapid
forcible delivery, quite different from the frothy excited
loquacity of an Italian.&nbsp; So he stared while the homunculus
letting his cloak fall about him, aspired an immense quantity of
snuff out of the hollow of his palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mule,&rdquo; exclaimed Byrne seizing at last the real
aspect of the discourse.&nbsp; &ldquo;You say he has got a
mule?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s queer!&nbsp; Why did he refuse to let me
have it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The diminutive Spaniard muffled himself up again with great
dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quien sabe</i>,&rdquo; he said coldly, with a shrug
of his draped shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is a great
<i>politico</i> in everything he does.&nbsp; But one thing your
worship may be certain of&mdash;that his intentions are always
rascally.&nbsp; This husband of my <i>defunta</i> sister ought to
have been married a long time ago to the widow with the wooden
legs.&rdquo; <a name="citation188"></a><a href="#footnote188"
class="citation">[188]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&nbsp; But remember that, whatever your motives,
your worship countenanced him in this lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bright unhappy eyes on each side of a predatory nose
confronted Byrne without wincing, while with that testiness which
lurks so often at the bottom of Spanish dignity&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt the se&ntilde;or officer would not lose an
ounce of blood if I were stuck under the fifth rib,&rdquo; he
retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what of this poor sinner
here?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then changing his tone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, by the necessities of the times I live here
in exile, a Castilian and an old Christian, existing miserably in
the midst of these brute Asturians, and dependent on the worst of
them all, who has less conscience and scruples than a wolf.&nbsp;
And being a man of intelligence I govern myself
accordingly.&nbsp; Yet I can hardly contain my scorn.&nbsp; You
have heard the way I spoke.&nbsp; A caballero of parts like your
worship might have guessed that there was a cat in
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What cat?&rdquo; said Byrne uneasily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
I see.&nbsp; Something suspicious.&nbsp; No, se&ntilde;or.&nbsp;
I guessed nothing.&nbsp; My nation are not good guessers at that
sort of thing; and, therefore, I ask you plainly whether that
wine-seller has spoken the truth in other particulars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are certainly no Frenchmen anywhere about,&rdquo;
said the little man with a return to his indifferent manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or robbers&mdash;<i>ladrones</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ladrones en grande</i>&mdash;no!&nbsp; Assuredly
not,&rdquo; was the answer in a cold philosophical tone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is there left for them to do after the French?&nbsp;
And nobody travels in these times.&nbsp; But who can say!&nbsp;
Opportunity makes the robber.&nbsp; Still that mariner of yours
has a fierce aspect, and with the son of a cat rats will have no
play.&nbsp; But there is a saying, too, that where honey is there
will soon be flies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This oracular discourse exasperated Byrne.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the
name of God,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;tell me plainly if you think
my man is reasonably safe on his journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The homunculus, undergoing one of his rapid changes, seized
the officer&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp; The grip of his little hand was
astonishing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or!&nbsp; Bernardino had taken notice of
him.&nbsp; What more do you want?&nbsp; And listen&mdash;men have
disappeared on this road&mdash;on a certain portion of this road,
when Bernardino kept a <i>meson</i>, an inn, and I, his
brother-in-law, had coaches and mules for hire.&nbsp; Now there
are no travellers, no coaches.&nbsp; The French have ruined
me.&nbsp; Bernardino has retired here for reasons of his own
after my sister died.&nbsp; They were three to torment the life
out of her, he and Erminia and Lucilla, two aunts of
his&mdash;all affiliated to the devil.&nbsp; And now he has
robbed me of my last mule.&nbsp; You are an armed man.&nbsp;
Demand the <i>macho</i> from him, with a pistol to his head,
se&ntilde;or&mdash;it is not his, I tell you&mdash;and ride after
your man who is so precious to you.&nbsp; And then you shall both
be safe, for no two travellers have been ever known to disappear
together in these days.&nbsp; As to the beast, I, its owner, I
confide it to your honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were staring hard at each other, and Byrne nearly burst
into a laugh at the ingenuity and transparency of the little
man&rsquo;s plot to regain possession of his mule.&nbsp; But he
had no difficulty to keep a straight face because he felt deep
within himself a strange inclination to do that very
extraordinary thing.&nbsp; He did not laugh, but his lip
quivered; at which the diminutive Spaniard, detaching his black
glittering eyes from Byrne&rsquo;s face, turned his back on him
brusquely with a gesture and a fling of the cloak which somehow
expressed contempt, bitterness, and discouragement all at
once.&nbsp; He turned away and stood still, his hat aslant,
muffled up to the ears.&nbsp; But he was not offended to the
point of refusing the silver <i>duro</i> which Byrne offered him
with a non-committal speech as if nothing extraordinary had
passed between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must make haste on board now,&rdquo; said Byrne,
then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Vaya usted con Dios</i>,&rdquo; muttered the
gnome.&nbsp; And this interview ended with a sarcastic low sweep
of the hat which was replaced at the same perilous angle as
before.</p>
<p>Directly the boat had been hoisted the ship&rsquo;s sails were
filled on the off-shore tack, and Byrne imparted the whole story
to his captain, who was but a very few years older than
himself.&nbsp; There was some amused indignation at it&mdash;but
while they laughed they looked gravely at each other.&nbsp; A
Spanish dwarf trying to beguile an officer of his majesty&rsquo;s
navy into stealing a mule for him&mdash;that was too funny, too
ridiculous, too incredible.&nbsp; Those were the exclamations of
the captain.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t get over the grotesqueness
of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incredible.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; murmured
Byrne at last in a significant tone.</p>
<p>They exchanged a long stare.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as clear
as daylight,&rdquo; affirmed the captain impatiently, because in
his heart he was not certain.&nbsp; And Tom the best seaman in
the ship for one, the good-humouredly deferential friend of his
boyhood for the other, was becoming endowed with a compelling
fascination, like a symbolic figure of loyalty appealing to their
feelings and their conscience, so that they could not detach
their thoughts from his safety.&nbsp; Several times they went up
on deck, only to look at the coast, as if it could tell them
something of his fate.&nbsp; It stretched away, lengthening in
the distance, mute, naked, and savage, veiled now and then by the
slanting cold shafts of rain.&nbsp; The westerly swell rolled its
interminable angry lines of foam and big dark clouds flew over
the ship in a sinister procession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to goodness you had done what your little friend
in the yellow hat wanted you to do,&rdquo; said the commander of
the sloop late in the afternoon with visible exasperation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you, sir?&rdquo; answered Byrne, bitter with
positive anguish.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder what you would have said
afterwards?&nbsp; Why!&nbsp; I might have been kicked out of the
service for looting a mule from a nation in alliance with His
Majesty.&nbsp; Or I might have been battered to a pulp with
flails and pitch-forks&mdash;a pretty tale to get abroad about
one of your officers&mdash;while trying to steal a mule.&nbsp; Or
chased ignominiously to the boat&mdash;for you would not have
expected me to shoot down unoffending people for the sake of a
mangy mule. . . And yet,&rdquo; he added in a low voice, &ldquo;I
almost wish myself I had done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before dark those two young men had worked themselves up into
a highly complex psychological state of scornful scepticism and
alarmed credulity.&nbsp; It tormented them exceedingly; and the
thought that it would have to last for six days at least, and
possibly be prolonged further for an indefinite time, was not to
be borne.&nbsp; The ship was therefore put on the inshore tack at
dark.&nbsp; All through the gusty dark night she went towards the
land to look for her man, at times lying over in the heavy puffs,
at others rolling idle in the swell, nearly stationary, as if she
too had a mind of her own to swing perplexed between cool reason
and warm impulse.</p>
<p>Then just at daybreak a boat put off from her and went on
tossed by the seas towards the shallow cove where, with
considerable difficulty, an officer in a thick coat and a round
hat managed to land on a strip of shingle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my wish,&rdquo; writes Mr. Byrne, &ldquo;a wish
of which my captain approved, to land secretly if possible.&nbsp;
I did not want to be seen either by my aggrieved friend in the
yellow hat, whose motives were not clear, or by the one-eyed
wine-seller, who may or may not have been affiliated to the
devil, or indeed by any other dweller in that primitive
village.&nbsp; But unfortunately the cove was the only possible
landing place for miles; and from the steepness of the ravine I
couldn&rsquo;t make a circuit to avoid the houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunately,&rdquo; he goes on, &ldquo;all the people
were yet in their beds.&nbsp; It was barely daylight when I found
myself walking on the thick layer of sodden leaves filling the
only street.&nbsp; No soul was stirring abroad, no dog
barked.&nbsp; The silence was profound, and I had concluded with
some wonder that apparently no dogs were kept in the hamlet, when
I heard a low snarl, and from a noisome alley between two hovels
emerged a vile cur with its tail between its legs.&nbsp; He slunk
off silently showing me his teeth as he ran before me, and he
disappeared so suddenly that he might have been the unclean
incarnation of the Evil One.&nbsp; There was, too, something so
weird in the manner of its coming and vanishing, that my spirits,
already by no means very high, became further depressed by the
revolting sight of this creature as if by an unlucky
presage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got away from the coast unobserved, as far as he knew, then
struggled manfully to the west against wind and rain, on a barren
dark upland, under a sky of ashes.&nbsp; Far away the harsh and
desolate mountains raising their scarped and denuded ridges
seemed to wait for him menacingly.&nbsp; The evening found him
fairly near to them, but, in sailor language, uncertain of his
position, hungry, wet, and tired out by a day of steady tramping
over broken ground during which he had seen very few people, and
had been unable to obtain the slightest intelligence of Tom
Corbin&rsquo;s passage.&nbsp; &ldquo;On! on! I must push
on,&rdquo; he had been saying to himself through the hours of
solitary effort, spurred more by incertitude than by any definite
fear or definite hope.</p>
<p>The lowering daylight died out quickly, leaving him faced by a
broken bridge.&nbsp; He descended into the ravine, forded a
narrow stream by the last gleam of rapid water, and clambering
out on the other side was met by the night which fell like a
bandage over his eyes.&nbsp; The wind sweeping in the darkness
the broadside of the sierra worried his ears by a continuous
roaring noise as of a maddened sea.&nbsp; He suspected that he
had lost the road.&nbsp; Even in daylight, with its ruts and
mud-holes and ledges of outcropping stone, it was difficult to
distinguish from the dreary waste of the moor interspersed with
boulders and clumps of naked bushes.&nbsp; But, as he says,
&ldquo;he steered his course by the feel of the wind,&rdquo; his
hat rammed low on his brow, his head down, stopping now and again
from mere weariness of mind rather than of body&mdash;as if not
his strength but his resolution were being overtaxed by the
strain of endeavour half suspected to be vain, and by the unrest
of his feelings.</p>
<p>In one of these pauses borne in the wind faintly as if from
very far away he heard a sound of knocking, just knocking on
wood.&nbsp; He noticed that the wind had lulled suddenly.</p>
<p>His heart started beating tumultuously because in himself he
carried the impression of the desert solitudes he had been
traversing for the last six hours&mdash;the oppressive sense of
an uninhabited world.&nbsp; When he raised his head a gleam of
light, illusory as it often happens in dense darkness, swam
before his eyes.&nbsp; While he peered, the sound of feeble
knocking was repeated&mdash;and suddenly he felt rather than saw
the existence of a massive obstacle in his path.&nbsp; What was
it?&nbsp; The spur of a hill?&nbsp; Or was it a house!&nbsp;
Yes.&nbsp; It was a house right close, as though it had risen
from the ground or had come gliding to meet him, dumb and pallid;
from some dark recess of the night.&nbsp; It towered
loftily.&nbsp; He had come up under its lee; another three steps
and he could have touched the wall with his hand.&nbsp; It was no
doubt a <i>posada</i> and some other traveller was trying for
admittance.&nbsp; He heard again the sound of cautious
knocking.</p>
<p>Next moment a broad band of light fell into the night through
the opened door.&nbsp; Byrne stepped eagerly into it, whereupon
the person outside leaped with a stifled cry away into the
night.&nbsp; An exclamation of surprise was heard too, from
within.&nbsp; Byrne, flinging himself against the half closed
door, forced his way in against some considerable resistance.</p>
<p>A miserable candle, a mere rushlight, burned at the end of a
long deal table.&nbsp; And in its light Byrne saw, staggering
yet, the girl he had driven from the door.&nbsp; She had a short
black skirt, an orange shawl, a dark complexion&mdash;and the
escaped single hairs from the mass, sombre and thick like a
forest and held up by a comb, made a black mist about her low
forehead.&nbsp; A shrill lamentable howl of:
&ldquo;Misericordia!&rdquo; came in two voices from the further
end of the long room, where the fire-light of an open hearth
played between heavy shadows.&nbsp; The girl recovering herself
drew a hissing breath through her set teeth.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to report the long process of questions and
answers by which he soothed the fears of two old women who sat on
each side of the fire, on which stood a large earthenware
pot.&nbsp; Byrne thought at once of two witches watching the
brewing of some deadly potion.&nbsp; But all the same, when one
of them raising forward painfully her broken form lifted the
cover of the pot, the escaping steam had an appetising
smell.&nbsp; The other did not budge, but sat hunched up, her
head trembling all the time.</p>
<p>They were horrible.&nbsp; There was something grotesque in
their decrepitude.&nbsp; Their toothless mouths, their hooked
noses, the meagreness of the active one, and the hanging yellow
cheeks of the other (the still one, whose head trembled) would
have been laughable if the sight of their dreadful physical
degradation had not been appalling to one&rsquo;s eyes, had not
gripped one&rsquo;s heart with poignant amazement at the
unspeakable misery of age, at the awful persistency of life
becoming at last an object of disgust and dread.</p>
<p>To get over it Byrne began to talk, saying that he was an
Englishman, and that he was in search of a countryman who ought
to have passed this way.&nbsp; Directly he had spoken the
recollection of his parting with Tom came up in his mind with
amazing vividness: the silent villagers, the angry gnome, the
one-eyed wine-seller, Bernardino.&nbsp; Why!&nbsp; These two
unspeakable frights must be that man&rsquo;s
aunts&mdash;affiliated to the devil.</p>
<p>Whatever they had been once it was impossible to imagine what
use such feeble creatures could be to the devil, now, in the
world of the living.&nbsp; Which was Lucilla and which was
Erminia?&nbsp; They were now things without a name.&nbsp; A
moment of suspended animation followed Byrne&rsquo;s words.&nbsp;
The sorceress with the spoon ceased stirring the mess in the iron
pot, the very trembling of the other&rsquo;s head stopped for the
space of breath.&nbsp; In this infinitesimal fraction of a second
Byrne had the sense of being really on his quest, of having
reached the turn of the path, almost within hail of Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have seen him,&rdquo; he thought with
conviction.&nbsp; Here was at last somebody who had seen
him.&nbsp; He made sure they would deny all knowledge of the
Ingles; but on the contrary they were eager to tell him that he
had eaten and slept the night in the house.&nbsp; They both
started talking together, describing his appearance and
behaviour.&nbsp; An excitement quite fierce in its feebleness
possessed them.&nbsp; The doubled-up sorceress flourished aloft
her wooden spoon, the puffy monster got off her stool and
screeched, stepping from one foot to the other, while the
trembling of her head was accelerated to positive
vibration.&nbsp; Byrne was quite disconcerted by their excited
behaviour. . . Yes!&nbsp; The big, fierce Ingles went away in the
morning, after eating a piece of bread and drinking some
wine.&nbsp; And if the caballero wished to follow the same path
nothing could be easier&mdash;in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will give me somebody to show me the way?&rdquo;
said Byrne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Si, se&ntilde;or.&nbsp; A proper youth.&nbsp; The man
the caballero saw going out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he was knocking at the door,&rdquo; protested
Byrne.&nbsp; &ldquo;He only bolted when he saw me.&nbsp; He was
coming in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; No!&rdquo; the two horrid witches screamed
out together.&nbsp; &ldquo;Going out. Going out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After all it may have been true. The sound of knocking had
been faint, elusive, reflected Byrne.&nbsp; Perhaps only the
effect of his fancy.&nbsp; He asked&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her <i>novio</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; They screamed pointing
to the girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is gone home to a village far away
from here.&nbsp; But he will return in the morning.&nbsp; Her
<i>novio</i>!&nbsp; And she is an orphan&mdash;the child of poor
Christian people.&nbsp; She lives with us for the love of God,
for the love of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The orphan crouching on the corner of the hearth had been
looking at Byrne.&nbsp; He thought that she was more like a child
of Satan kept there by these two weird harridans for the love of
the Devil.&nbsp; Her eyes were a little oblique, her mouth rather
thick, but admirably formed; her dark face had a wild beauty,
voluptuous and untamed.&nbsp; As to the character of her
steadfast gaze attached upon him with a sensuously savage
attention, &ldquo;to know what it was like,&rdquo; says Mr.
Byrne, &ldquo;you have only to observe a hungry cat watching a
bird in a cage or a mouse inside a trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was she who served him the food, of which he was glad;
though with those big slanting black eyes examining him at close
range, as if he had something curious written on his face, she
gave him an uncomfortable sensation.&nbsp; But anything was
better than being approached by these blear-eyed nightmarish
witches.&nbsp; His apprehensions somehow had been soothed;
perhaps by the sensation of warmth after severe exposure and the
ease of resting after the exertion of fighting the gale inch by
inch all the way.&nbsp; He had no doubt of Tom&rsquo;s
safety.&nbsp; He was now sleeping in the mountain camp having
been met by Gonzales&rsquo; men.</p>
<p>Byrne rose, filled a tin goblet with wine out of a skin
hanging on the wall, and sat down again.&nbsp; The witch with the
mummy face began to talk to him, ramblingly of old times; she
boasted of the inn&rsquo;s fame in those better days.&nbsp; Great
people in their own coaches stopped there.&nbsp; An archbishop
slept once in the <i>casa</i>, a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>The witch with the puffy face seemed to be listening from her
stool, motionless, except for the trembling of her head.&nbsp;
The girl (Byrne was certain she was a casual gipsy admitted there
for some reason or other) sat on the hearth stone in the glow of
the embers.&nbsp; She hummed a tune to herself, rattling a pair
of castanets slightly now and then.&nbsp; At the mention of the
archbishop she chuckled impiously and turned her head to look at
Byrne, so that the red glow of the fire flashed in her black eyes
and on her white teeth under the dark cowl of the enormous
overmantel.&nbsp; And he smiled at her.</p>
<p>He rested now in the ease of security.&nbsp; His advent not
having been expected there could be no plot against him in
existence.&nbsp; Drowsiness stole upon his senses.&nbsp; He
enjoyed it, but keeping a hold, so he thought at least, on his
wits; but he must have been gone further than he thought because
he was startled beyond measure by a fiendish uproar.&nbsp; He had
never heard anything so pitilessly strident in his life.&nbsp;
The witches had started a fierce quarrel about something or
other.&nbsp; Whatever its origin they were now only abusing each
other violently, without arguments; their senile screams
expressed nothing but wicked anger and ferocious dismay.&nbsp;
The gipsy girl&rsquo;s black eyes flew from one to the
other.&nbsp; Never before had Byrne felt himself so removed from
fellowship with human beings.&nbsp; Before he had really time to
understand the subject of the quarrel, the girl jumped up
rattling her castanets loudly.&nbsp; A silence fell.&nbsp; She
came up to the table and bending over, her eyes in his&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; she said with decision, &ldquo;You
shall sleep in the archbishop&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither of the witches objected.&nbsp; The dried-up one bent
double was propped on a stick.&nbsp; The puffy faced one had now
a crutch.</p>
<p>Byrne got up, walked to the door, and turning the key in the
enormous lock put it coolly in his pocket.&nbsp; This was clearly
the only entrance, and he did not mean to be taken unawares by
whatever danger there might have been lurking outside.</p>
<p>When he turned from the door he saw the two witches
&ldquo;affiliated to the Devil&rdquo; and the Satanic girl
looking at him in silence.&nbsp; He wondered if Tom Corbin took
the same precaution last might.&nbsp; And thinking of him he had
again that queer impression of his nearness.&nbsp; The world was
perfectly dumb.&nbsp; And in this stillness he heard the blood
beating in his ears with a confused rushing noise, in which there
seemed to be a voice uttering the words: &ldquo;Mr. Byrne, look
out, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tom&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; He shuddered; for
the delusions of the senses of hearing are the most vivid of all,
and from their nature have a compelling character.</p>
<p>It seemed impossible that Tom should not be there.&nbsp; Again
a slight chill as of stealthy draught penetrated through his very
clothes and passed over all his body.&nbsp; He shook off the
impression with an effort.</p>
<p>It was the girl who preceded him upstairs carrying an iron
lamp from the naked flame of which ascended a thin thread of
smoke.&nbsp; Her soiled white stockings were full of holes.</p>
<p>With the same quiet resolution with which he had locked the
door below, Byrne threw open one after another the doors in the
corridor.&nbsp; All the rooms were empty except for some
nondescript lumber in one or two.&nbsp; And the girl seeing what
he would be at stopped every time, raising the smoky light in
each doorway patiently.&nbsp; Meantime she observed him with
sustained attention.&nbsp; The last door of all she threw open
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sleep here, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; she murmured in a
voice light like a child&rsquo;s breath, offering him the
lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Buenos noches</i>, <i>senorita</i>,&rdquo; he said
politely, taking it from her.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t return the wish audibly, though her lips did
move a little, while her gaze black like a starless night never
for a moment wavered before him.&nbsp; He stepped in, and as he
turned to close the door she was still there motionless and
disturbing, with her voluptuous mouth and slanting eyes, with the
expression of expectant sensual ferocity of a baffled cat.&nbsp;
He hesitated for a moment, and in the dumb house he heard again
the blood pulsating ponderously in his ears, while once more the
illusion of Tom&rsquo;s voice speaking earnestly somewhere near
by was specially terrifying, because this time he could not make
out the words.</p>
<p>He slammed the door in the girl&rsquo;s face at last, leaving
her in the dark; and he opened it again almost on the
instant.&nbsp; Nobody.&nbsp; She had vanished without the
slightest sound.&nbsp; He closed the door quickly and bolted it
with two heavy bolts.</p>
<p>A profound mistrust possessed him suddenly.&nbsp; Why did the
witches quarrel about letting him sleep here?&nbsp; And what
meant that stare of the girl as if she wanted to impress his
features for ever in her mind?&nbsp; His own nervousness alarmed
him.&nbsp; He seemed to himself to be removed very far from
mankind.</p>
<p>He examined his room.&nbsp; It was not very high, just high
enough to take the bed which stood under an enormous
baldaquin-like canopy from which fell heavy curtains at foot and
head; a bed certainly worthy of an archbishop.&nbsp; There was a
heavy table carved all round the edges, some arm-chairs of
enormous weight like the spoils of a grandee&rsquo;s palace; a
tall shallow wardrobe placed against the wall and with double
doors.&nbsp; He tried them.&nbsp; Locked.&nbsp; A suspicion came
into his mind, and he snatched the lamp to make a closer
examination.&nbsp; No, it was not a disguised entrance.&nbsp;
That heavy, tall piece of furniture stood clear of the wall by
quite an inch.&nbsp; He glanced at the bolts of his room
door.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; No one could get at him treacherously while
he slept.&nbsp; But would he be able to sleep? he asked himself
anxiously.&nbsp; If only he had Tom there&mdash;the trusty seaman
who had fought at his right hand in a cutting out affair or two,
and had always preached to him the necessity to take care of
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;For it&rsquo;s no great trick,&rdquo; he
used to say, &ldquo;to get yourself killed in a hot fight.&nbsp;
Any fool can do that.&nbsp; The proper pastime is to fight the
Frenchies and then live to fight another day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Byrne found it a hard matter not to fall into listening to the
silence.&nbsp; Somehow he had the conviction that nothing would
break it unless he heard again the haunting sound of Tom&rsquo;s
voice.&nbsp; He had heard it twice before.&nbsp; Odd!&nbsp; And
yet no wonder, he argued with himself reasonably, since he had
been thinking of the man for over thirty hours continuously and,
what&rsquo;s more, inconclusively.&nbsp; For his anxiety for Tom
had never taken a definite shape.&nbsp; &ldquo;Disappear,&rdquo;
was the only word connected with the idea of Tom&rsquo;s
danger.&nbsp; It was very vague and awful.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Disappear!&rdquo;&nbsp; What did that mean?</p>
<p>Byrne shuddered, and then said to himself that he must be a
little feverish.&nbsp; But Tom had not disappeared.&nbsp; Byrne
had just heard of him.&nbsp; And again the young man felt the
blood beating in his ears.&nbsp; He sat still expecting every
moment to hear through the pulsating strokes the sound of
Tom&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; He waited straining his ears, but
nothing came.&nbsp; Suddenly the thought occurred to him:
&ldquo;He has not disappeared, but he cannot make himself
heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He jumped up from the arm-chair.&nbsp; How absurd!&nbsp;
Laying his pistol and his hanger on the table he took off his
boots and, feeling suddenly too tired to stand, flung himself on
the bed which he found soft and comfortable beyond his hopes.</p>
<p>He had felt very wakeful, but he must have dozed off after
all, because the next thing he knew he was sitting up in bed and
trying to recollect what it was that Tom&rsquo;s voice had
said.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; He remembered it now.&nbsp; It had said:
&ldquo;Mr. Byrne!&nbsp; Look out, sir!&rdquo;&nbsp; A warning
this.&nbsp; But against what?</p>
<p>He landed with one leap in the middle of the floor, gasped
once, then looked all round the room.&nbsp; The window was
shuttered and barred with an iron bar.&nbsp; Again he ran his
eyes slowly all round the bare walls, and even looked up at the
ceiling, which was rather high.&nbsp; Afterwards he went to the
door to examine the fastenings.&nbsp; They consisted of two
enormous iron bolts sliding into holes made in the wall; and as
the corridor outside was too narrow to admit of any battering
arrangement or even to permit an axe to be swung, nothing could
burst the door open&mdash;unless gunpowder.&nbsp; But while he
was still making sure that the lower bolt was pushed well home,
he received the impression of somebody&rsquo;s presence in the
room.&nbsp; It was so strong that he spun round quicker than
lightning.&nbsp; There was no one.&nbsp; Who could there
be?&nbsp; And yet . . .</p>
<p>It was then that he lost the decorum and restraint a man keeps
up for his own sake.&nbsp; He got down on his hands and knees,
with the lamp on the floor, to look under the bed, like a silly
girl.&nbsp; He saw a lot of dust and nothing else.&nbsp; He got
up, his cheeks burning, and walked about discontented with his
own behaviour and unreasonably angry with Tom for not leaving him
alone.&nbsp; The words: &ldquo;Mr. Byrne!&nbsp; Look out,
sir,&rdquo; kept on repeating themselves in his head in a tone of
warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t I better just throw myself on the bed and
try to go to sleep,&rdquo; he asked himself.&nbsp; But his eyes
fell on the tall wardrobe, and he went towards it feeling
irritated with himself and yet unable to desist.&nbsp; How he
could explain to-morrow the burglarious misdeed to the two odious
witches he had no idea.&nbsp; Nevertheless he inserted the point
of his hanger between the two halves of the door and tried to
prize them open.&nbsp; They resisted.&nbsp; He swore, sticking
now hotly to his purpose.&nbsp; His mutter: &ldquo;I hope you
will be satisfied, confound you,&rdquo; was addressed to the
absent Tom.&nbsp; Just then the doors gave way and flew open.</p>
<p>He was there.</p>
<p>He&mdash;the trusty, sagacious, and courageous Tom was there,
drawn up shadowy and stiff, in a prudent silence, which his
wide-open eyes by their fixed gleam seemed to command Byrne to
respect.&nbsp; But Byrne was too startled to make a sound.&nbsp;
Amazed, he stepped back a little&mdash;and on the instant the
seaman flung himself forward headlong as if to clasp his officer
round the neck.&nbsp; Instinctively Byrne put out his faltering
arms; he felt the horrible rigidity of the body and then the
coldness of death as their heads knocked together and their faces
came into contact.&nbsp; They reeled, Byrne hugging Tom close to
his breast in order not to let him fall with a crash.&nbsp; He
had just strength enough to lower the awful burden gently to the
floor&mdash;then his head swam, his legs gave way, and he sank on
his knees, leaning over the body with his hands resting on the
breast of that man once full of generous life, and now as
insensible as a stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead! my poor Tom, dead,&rdquo; he repeated
mentally.&nbsp; The light of the lamp standing near the edge of
the table fell from above straight on the stony empty stare of
these eyes which naturally had a mobile and merry expression.</p>
<p>Byrne turned his own away from them.&nbsp; Tom&rsquo;s black
silk neckerchief was not knotted on his breast.&nbsp; It was
gone.&nbsp; The murderers had also taken off his shoes and
stockings.&nbsp; And noticing this spoliation, the exposed
throat, the bare up-turned feet, Byrne felt his eyes run full of
tears.&nbsp; In other respects the seaman was fully dressed;
neither was his clothing disarranged as it must have been in a
violent struggle.&nbsp; Only his checked shirt had been pulled a
little out the waistband in one place, just enough to ascertain
whether he had a money belt fastened round his body.&nbsp; Byrne
began to sob into his handkerchief.</p>
<p>It was a nervous outburst which passed off quickly.&nbsp;
Remaining on his knees he contemplated sadly the athletic body of
as fine a seaman as ever had drawn a cutlass, laid a gun, or
passed the weather earring in a gale, lying stiff and cold, his
cheery, fearless spirit departed&mdash;perhaps turning to him,
his boy chum, to his ship out there rolling on the grey seas off
an iron-bound coast, at the very moment of its flight.</p>
<p>He perceived that the six brass buttons of Tom&rsquo;s jacket
had been cut off.&nbsp; He shuddered at the notion of the two
miserable and repulsive witches busying themselves ghoulishly
about the defenceless body of his friend.&nbsp; Cut off.&nbsp;
Perhaps with the same knife which . . . The head of one trembled;
the other was bent double, and their eyes were red and bleared,
their infamous claws unsteady. . . It must have been in this very
room too, for Tom could not have been killed in the open and
brought in here afterwards.&nbsp; Of that Byrne was
certain.&nbsp; Yet those devilish crones could not have killed
him themselves even by taking him unawares&mdash;and Tom would be
always on his guard of course.&nbsp; Tom was a very wide awake
wary man when engaged on any service. . . And in fact how did
they murder him?&nbsp; Who did?&nbsp; In what way?</p>
<p>Byrne jumped up, snatched the lamp off the table, and stooped
swiftly over the body.&nbsp; The light revealed on the clothing
no stain, no trace, no spot of blood anywhere.&nbsp;
Byrne&rsquo;s hands began to shake so that he had to set the lamp
on the floor and turn away his head in order to recover from this
agitation.</p>
<p>Then he began to explore that cold, still, and rigid body for
a stab, a gunshot wound, for the trace of some killing
blow.&nbsp; He felt all over the skull anxiously.&nbsp; It was
whole.&nbsp; He slipped his hand under the neck.&nbsp; It was
unbroken.&nbsp; With terrified eyes he peered close under the
chin and saw no marks of strangulation on the throat.</p>
<p>There were no signs anywhere.&nbsp; He was just dead.</p>
<p>Impulsively Byrne got away from the body as if the mystery of
an incomprehensible death had changed his pity into suspicion and
dread.&nbsp; The lamp on the floor near the set, still face of
the seaman showed it staring at the ceiling as if
despairingly.&nbsp; In the circle of light Byrne saw by the
undisturbed patches of thick dust on the floor that there had
been no struggle in that room.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has died
outside,&rdquo; he thought.&nbsp; Yes, outside in that narrow
corridor, where there was hardly room to turn, the mysterious
death had come to his poor dear Tom.&nbsp; The impulse of
snatching up his pistols and rushing out of the room abandoned
Byrne suddenly.&nbsp; For Tom, too, had been armed&mdash;with
just such powerless weapons as he himself
possessed&mdash;pistols, a cutlass!&nbsp; And Tom had died a
nameless death, by incomprehensible means.</p>
<p>A new thought came to Byrne.&nbsp; That stranger knocking at
the door and fleeing so swiftly at his appearance had come there
to remove the body.&nbsp; Aha!&nbsp; That was the guide the
withered witch had promised would show the English officer the
shortest way of rejoining his man.&nbsp; A promise, he saw it
now, of dreadful import.&nbsp; He who had knocked would have two
bodies to deal with.&nbsp; Man and officer would go forth from
the house together.&nbsp; For Byrne was certain now that he would
have to die before the morning&mdash;and in the same mysterious
manner, leaving behind him an unmarked body.</p>
<p>The sight of a smashed head, of a throat cut, of a gaping
gunshot wound, would have been an inexpressible relief.&nbsp; It
would have soothed all his fears.&nbsp; His soul cried within him
to that dead man whom he had never found wanting in danger.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell me what I am to look for,
Tom?&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;&nbsp; But in rigid
immobility, extended on his back, he seemed to preserve an
austere silence, as if disdaining in the finality of his awful
knowledge to hold converse with the living.</p>
<p>Suddenly Byrne flung himself on his knees by the side of the
body, and dry-eyed, fierce, opened the shirt wide on the breast,
as if to tear the secret forcibly from that cold heart which had
been so loyal to him in life!&nbsp; Nothing!&nbsp; Nothing!&nbsp;
He raised the lamp, and all the sign vouchsafed to him by that
face which used to be so kindly in expression was a small bruise
on the forehead&mdash;the least thing, a mere mark.&nbsp; The
skin even was not broken.&nbsp; He stared at it a long time as if
lost in a dreadful dream.&nbsp; Then he observed that Tom&rsquo;s
hands were clenched as though he had fallen facing somebody in a
fight with fists.&nbsp; His knuckles, on closer view, appeared
somewhat abraded.&nbsp; Both hands.</p>
<p>The discovery of these slight signs was more appalling to
Byrne than the absolute absence of every mark would have
been.&nbsp; So Tom had died striking against something which
could be hit, and yet could kill one without leaving a
wound&mdash;by a breath.</p>
<p>Terror, hot terror, began to play about Byrne&rsquo;s heart
like a tongue of flame that touches and withdraws before it turns
a thing to ashes.&nbsp; He backed away from the body as far as he
could, then came forward stealthily casting fearful glances to
steal another look at the bruised forehead.&nbsp; There would
perhaps be such a faint bruise on his own forehead&mdash;before
the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear it,&rdquo; he whispered to
himself.&nbsp; Tom was for him now an object of horror, a sight
at once tempting and revolting to his fear.&nbsp; He
couldn&rsquo;t bear to look at him.</p>
<p>At last, desperation getting the better of his increasing
horror, he stepped forward from the wall against which he had
been leaning, seized the corpse under the armpits, and began to
lug it over to the bed.&nbsp; The bare heels of the seaman
trailed on the floor noiselessly.&nbsp; He was heavy with the
dead weight of inanimate objects.&nbsp; With a last effort Byrne
landed him face downwards on the edge of the bed, rolled him
over, snatched from under this stiff passive thing a sheet with
which he covered it over.&nbsp; Then he spread the curtains at
head and foot so that joining together as he shook their folds
they hid the bed altogether from his sight.</p>
<p>He stumbled towards a chair, and fell on it.&nbsp; The
perspiration poured from his face for a moment, and then his
veins seemed to carry for a while a thin stream of half, frozen
blood.&nbsp; Complete terror had possession of him now, a
nameless terror which had turned his heart to ashes.</p>
<p>He sat upright in the straight-backed chair, the lamp burning
at his feet, his pistols and his hanger at his left elbow on the
end of the table, his eyes turning incessantly in their sockets
round the walls, over the ceiling, over the floor, in the
expectation of a mysterious and appalling vision.&nbsp; The thing
which could deal death in a breath was outside that bolted
door.&nbsp; But Byrne believed neither in walls nor bolts
now.&nbsp; Unreasoning terror turning everything to account, his
old time boyish admiration of the athletic Tom, the undaunted Tom
(he had seemed to him invincible), helped to paralyse his
faculties, added to his despair.</p>
<p>He was no longer Edgar Byrne.&nbsp; He was a tortured soul
suffering more anguish than any sinner&rsquo;s body had ever
suffered from rack or boot.&nbsp; The depth of his torment may be
measured when I say that this young man, as brave at least as the
average of his kind, contemplated seizing a pistol and firing
into his own head.&nbsp; But a deadly, chilly, langour was
spreading over his limbs.&nbsp; It was as if his flesh had been
wet plaster stiffening slowly about his ribs.&nbsp; Presently, he
thought, the two witches will be coming in, with crutch and
stick&mdash;horrible, grotesque, monstrous&mdash;affiliated to
the devil&mdash;to put a mark on his forehead, the tiny little
bruise of death.&nbsp; And he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do
anything.&nbsp; Tom had struck out at something, but he was not
like Tom.&nbsp; His limbs were dead already.&nbsp; He sat still,
dying the death over and over again; and the only part of him
which moved were his eyes, turning round and round in their
sockets, running over the walls, the floor, the ceiling, again
and again till suddenly they became motionless and
stony&mdash;starting out of his head fixed in the direction of
the bed.</p>
<p>He had seen the heavy curtains stir and shake as if the dead
body they concealed had turned over and sat up.&nbsp; Byrne, who
thought the world could hold no more terrors in store, felt his
hair stir at the roots.&nbsp; He gripped the arms of the chair,
his jaw fell, and the sweat broke out on his brow while his dry
tongue clove suddenly to the roof of his mouth.&nbsp; Again the
curtains stirred, but did not open.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,
Tom!&rdquo; Byrne made effort to shout, but all he heard was a
slight moan such as an uneasy sleeper may make.&nbsp; He felt
that his brain was going, for, now, it seemed to him that the
ceiling over the bed had moved, had slanted, and came level
again&mdash;and once more the closed curtains swayed gently as if
about to part.</p>
<p>Byrne closed his eyes not to see the awful apparition of the
seaman&rsquo;s corpse coming out animated by an evil
spirit.&nbsp; In the profound silence of the room he endured a
moment of frightful agony, then opened his eyes again.&nbsp; And
he saw at once that the curtains remained closed still, but that
the ceiling over the bed had risen quite a foot.&nbsp; With the
last gleam of reason left to him he understood that it was the
enormous baldaquin over the bed which was coming down, while the
curtains attached to it swayed softly, sinking gradually to the
floor.&nbsp; His drooping jaw snapped to&mdash;and half rising in
his chair he watched mutely the noiseless descent of the
monstrous canopy.&nbsp; It came down in short smooth rushes till
lowered half way or more, when it took a run and settled swiftly
its turtle-back shape with the deep border piece fitting exactly
the edge of the bedstead.&nbsp; A slight crack or two of wood
were heard, and the overpowering stillness of the room resumed
its sway.</p>
<p>Byrne stood up, gasped for breath, and let out a cry of rage
and dismay, the first sound which he is perfectly certain did
make its way past his lips on this night of terrors.&nbsp; This
then was the death he had escaped!&nbsp; This was the devilish
artifice of murder poor Tom&rsquo;s soul had perhaps tried from
beyond the border to warn him of.&nbsp; For this was how he had
died.&nbsp; Byrne was certain he had heard the voice of the
seaman, faintly distinct in his familiar phrase, &ldquo;Mr.
Byrne!&nbsp; Look out, sir!&rdquo; and again uttering words he
could not make out.&nbsp; But then the distance separating the
living from the dead is so great!&nbsp; Poor Tom had tried.&nbsp;
Byrne ran to the bed and attempted to lift up, to push off the
horrible lid smothering the body.&nbsp; It resisted his efforts,
heavy as lead, immovable like a tombstone.&nbsp; The rage of
vengeance made him desist; his head buzzed with chaotic thoughts
of extermination, he turned round the room as if he could find
neither his weapons nor the way out; and all the time he
stammered awful menaces. . .</p>
<p>A violent battering at the door of the inn recalled him to his
soberer senses.&nbsp; He flew to the window pulled the shutters
open, and looked out.&nbsp; In the faint dawn he saw below him a
mob of men.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; He would go and face at once this
murderous lot collected no doubt for his undoing.&nbsp; After his
struggle with nameless terrors he yearned for an open fray with
armed enemies.&nbsp; But he must have remained yet bereft of his
reason, because forgetting his weapons he rushed downstairs with
a wild cry, unbarred the door while blows were raining on it
outside, and flinging it open flew with his bare hands at the
throat of the first man he saw before him.&nbsp; They rolled over
together.&nbsp; Byrne&rsquo;s hazy intention was to break
through, to fly up the mountain path, and come back presently
with Gonzales&rsquo; men to exact an exemplary vengeance.&nbsp;
He fought furiously till a tree, a house, a mountain, seemed to
crash down upon his head&mdash;and he knew no more.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Here Mr. Byrne describes in detail the skilful manner in which
he found his broken head bandaged, informs us that he had lost a
great deal of blood, and ascribes the preservation of his sanity
to that circumstance.&nbsp; He sets down Gonzales&rsquo; profuse
apologies in full too.&nbsp; For it was Gonzales who, tired of
waiting for news from the English, had come down to the inn with
half his band, on his way to the sea.&nbsp; &ldquo;His
excellency,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;rushed out with fierce
impetuosity, and, moreover, was not known to us for a friend, and
so we . . . etc., etc.&nbsp; When asked what had become of the
witches, he only pointed his finger silently to the ground, then
voiced calmly a moral reflection: &ldquo;The passion for gold is
pitiless in the very old, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No doubt in former days they have put many a solitary
traveller to sleep in the archbishop&rsquo;s bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was also a gipsy girl there,&rdquo; said Byrne
feebly from the improvised litter on which he was being carried
to the coast by a squad of guerilleros.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was she who winched up that infernal machine, and it
was she too who lowered it that night,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&nbsp; Why?&rdquo; exclaimed Byrne.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why should she wish for my death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt for the sake of your excellency&rsquo;s coat
buttons,&rdquo; said politely the saturnine Gonzales.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We found those of the dead mariner concealed on her
person.&nbsp; But your excellency may rest assured that
everything that is fitting has been done on this
occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Byrne asked no more questions.&nbsp; There was still another
death which was considered by Gonzales as &ldquo;fitting to the
occasion.&rdquo;&nbsp; The one-eyed Bernardino stuck against the
wall of his wine-shop received the charge of six escopettas into
his breast.&nbsp; As the shots rang out the rough bier with
Tom&rsquo;s body on it went past carried by a bandit-like gang of
Spanish patriots down the ravine to the shore, where two boats
from the ship were waiting for what was left on earth of her best
seaman.</p>
<p>Mr. Byrne, very pale and weak, stepped into the boat which
carried the body of his humble friend.&nbsp; For it was decided
that Tom Corbin should rest far out in the bay of Biscay.&nbsp;
The officer took the tiller and, turning his head for the last
look at the shore, saw on the grey hillside something moving,
which he made out to be a little man in a yellow hat mounted on a
mule&mdash;that mule without which the fate of Tom Corbin would
have remained mysterious for ever.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 223</span>BECAUSE OF THE DOLLARS</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>While we were hanging about near the water&rsquo;s edge, as
sailors idling ashore will do (it was in the open space before
the Harbour Office of a great Eastern port), a man came towards
us from the &ldquo;front&rdquo; of business houses, aiming
obliquely at the landing steps.&nbsp; He attracted my attention
because in the movement of figures in white drill suits on the
pavement from which he stepped, his costume, the usual tunic and
trousers, being made of light grey flannel, made him
noticeable.</p>
<p>I had time to observe him.&nbsp; He was stout, but he was not
grotesque.&nbsp; His face was round and smooth, his complexion
very fair.&nbsp; On his nearer approach I saw a little moustache
made all the fairer by a good many white hairs.&nbsp; And he had,
for a stout man, quite a good chin.&nbsp; In passing us he
exchanged nods with the friend I was with and smiled.</p>
<p>My friend was Hollis, the fellow who had so many adventures
and had known so many queer people in that part of the (more or
less) gorgeous East in the days of his youth.&nbsp; He said:
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good man.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean good in
the sense of smart or skilful in his trade.&nbsp; I mean a really
<i>good</i> man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned round at once to look at the phenomenon.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;really <i>good</i> man&rdquo; had a very broad back.&nbsp;
I saw him signal a sampan to come alongside, get into it, and go
off in the direction of a cluster of local steamers anchored
close inshore.</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a seaman, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Commands that biggish dark-green steamer:
&lsquo;<i>Sissie</i>&mdash;Glasgow.&rsquo;&nbsp; He has never
commanded anything else but the
&lsquo;<i>Sissie</i>&mdash;Glasgow,&rsquo; only it wasn&rsquo;t
always the same <i>Sissie</i>.&nbsp; The first he had was about
half the length of this one, and we used to tell poor Davidson
that she was a size too small for him.&nbsp; Even at that time
Davidson had bulk.&nbsp; We warned him he would get callosities
on his shoulders and elbows because of the tight fit of his
command.&nbsp; And Davidson could well afford the smiles he gave
us for our chaff.&nbsp; He made lots of money in her.&nbsp; She
belonged to a portly Chinaman resembling a mandarin in a
picture-book, with goggles and thin drooping moustaches, and as
dignified as only a Celestial knows how to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best of Chinamen as employers is that they have
such gentlemanly instincts.&nbsp; Once they become convinced that
you are a straight man, they give you their unbounded
confidence.&nbsp; You simply can&rsquo;t do wrong, then.&nbsp;
And they are pretty quick judges of character, too.&nbsp;
Davidson&rsquo;s Chinaman was the first to find out his worth, on
some theoretical principle.&nbsp; One day in his counting-house,
before several white men he was heard to declare: &lsquo;Captain
Davidson is a good man.&rsquo;&nbsp; And that settled it.&nbsp;
After that you couldn&rsquo;t tell if it was Davidson who
belonged to the Chinaman or the Chinaman who belonged to
Davidson.&nbsp; It was he who, shortly before he died, ordered in
Glasgow the new <i>Sissie</i> for Davidson to command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We walked into the shade of the Harbour Office and leaned our
elbows on the parapet of the quay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was really meant to comfort poor Davidson,&rdquo;
continued Hollis.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you fancy anything more
na&iuml;vely touching than this old mandarin spending several
thousand pounds to console his white man?&nbsp; Well, there she
is.&nbsp; The old mandarin&rsquo;s sons have inherited her, and
Davidson with her; and he commands her; and what with his salary
and trading privileges he makes a lot of money; and everything is
as before; and Davidson even smiles&mdash;you have seen it?&nbsp;
Well, the smile&rsquo;s the only thing which isn&rsquo;t as
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Hollis,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;what do you
mean by good in this connection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there are men who are born good just as others
are born witty.&nbsp; What I mean is his nature.&nbsp; No
simpler, more scrupulously delicate soul had ever lived in such
a&mdash;a&mdash;comfortable envelope.&nbsp; How we used to laugh
at Davidson&rsquo;s fine scruples!&nbsp; In short, he&rsquo;s
thoroughly humane, and I don&rsquo;t imagine there can be much of
any other sort of goodness that counts on this earth.&nbsp; And
as he&rsquo;s that with a shade of particular refinement, I may
well call him a &lsquo;<i>really</i> good man.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew from old that Hollis was a firm believer in the final
value of shades.&nbsp; And I said: &ldquo;I
see&rdquo;&mdash;because I really did see Hollis&rsquo;s Davidson
in the sympathetic stout man who had passed us a little while
before.&nbsp; But I remembered that at the very moment he smiled
his placid face appeared veiled in melancholy&mdash;a sort of
spiritual shadow.&nbsp; I went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who on earth has paid him off for being so fine by
spoiling his smile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite a story, and I will tell it to you
if you like.&nbsp; Confound it!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s quite a
surprising one, too.&nbsp; Surprising in every way, but mostly in
the way it knocked over poor Davidson&mdash;and apparently only
because he is such a good sort.&nbsp; He was telling me all about
it only a few days ago.&nbsp; He said that when he saw these four
fellows with their heads in a bunch over the table, he at once
didn&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t like it at all.&nbsp;
You mustn&rsquo;t suppose that Davidson is a soft fool.&nbsp;
These men&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I had better begin at the beginning.&nbsp; We must
go back to the first time the old dollars had been called in by
our Government in exchange for a new issue.&nbsp; Just about the
time when I left these parts to go home for a long stay.&nbsp;
Every trader in the islands was thinking of getting his old
dollars sent up here in time, and the demand for empty French
wine cases&mdash;you know the dozen of vermouth or claret
size&mdash;was something unprecedented.&nbsp; The custom was to
pack the dollars in little bags of a hundred each.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know how many bags each case would hold.&nbsp; A good
lot.&nbsp; Pretty tidy sums must have been moving afloat just
then.&nbsp; But let us get away from here.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t do
to stay in the sun.&nbsp; Where could we&mdash;?&nbsp; I know!
let us go to those tiffin-rooms over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We moved over accordingly.&nbsp; Our appearance in the long
empty room at that early hour caused visible consternation
amongst the China boys.&nbsp; But Hollis led the way to one of
the tables between the windows screened by rattan blinds.&nbsp; A
brilliant half-light trembled on the ceiling, on the whitewashed
walls, bathed the multitude of vacant chairs and tables in a
peculiar, stealthy glow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&nbsp; We will get something to eat when
it&rsquo;s ready,&rdquo; he said, waving the anxious Chinaman
waiter aside.&nbsp; He took his temples touched with grey between
his hands, leaning over the table to bring his face, his dark,
keen eyes, closer to mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson then was commanding the steamer
<i>Sissie</i>&mdash;the little one which we used to chaff him
about.&nbsp; He ran her alone, with only the Malay serang for a
deck officer.&nbsp; The nearest approach to another white man on
board of her was the engineer, a Portuguese half-caste, as thin
as a lath and quite a youngster at that.&nbsp; For all practical
purposes Davidson was managing that command of his single-handed;
and of course this was known in the port.&nbsp; I am telling you
of it because the fact had its influence on the developments you
shall hear of presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His steamer, being so small, could go up tiny creeks
and into shallow bays and through reefs and over sand-banks,
collecting produce, where no other vessel but a native craft
would think of venturing.&nbsp; It is a paying game, often.&nbsp;
Davidson was known to visit in her places that no one else could
find and that hardly anybody had ever heard of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old dollars being called in, Davidson&rsquo;s
Chinaman thought that the <i>Sissie</i> would be just the thing
to collect them from small traders in the less frequented parts
of the Archipelago.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a good business.&nbsp; Such
cases of dollars are dumped aft in the ship&rsquo;s lazarette,
and you get good freight for very little trouble and space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson, too, thought it was a good idea; and together
they made up a list of his calls on his next trip.&nbsp; Then
Davidson (he had naturally the chart of his voyages in his head)
remarked that on his way back he might look in at a certain
settlement up a mere creek, where a poor sort of white man lived
in a native village.&nbsp; Davidson pointed out to his Chinaman
that the fellow was certain to have some rattans to ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Probably enough to fill her forward,&rsquo; said
Davidson.&nbsp; &lsquo;And that&rsquo;ll be better than bringing
her back with empty holds.&nbsp; A day more or less doesn&rsquo;t
matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was sound talk, and the Chinaman owner could not
but agree.&nbsp; But if it hadn&rsquo;t been sound it would have
been just the same.&nbsp; Davidson did what he liked.&nbsp; He
was a man that could do no wrong.&nbsp; However, this suggestion
of his was not merely a business matter.&nbsp; There was in it a
touch of Davidsonian kindness.&nbsp; For you must know that the
man could not have continued to live quietly up that creek if it
had not been for Davidson&rsquo;s willingness to call there from
time to time.&nbsp; And Davidson&rsquo;s Chinaman knew this
perfectly well, too.&nbsp; So he only smiled his dignified, bland
smile, and said: &lsquo;All right, Captain.&nbsp; You do what you
like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will explain presently how this connection between
Davidson and that fellow came about.&nbsp; Now I want to tell you
about the part of this affair which happened here&mdash;the
preliminaries of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know as well as I do that these tiffin-rooms where
we are sitting now have been in existence for many years.&nbsp;
Well, next day about twelve o&rsquo;clock, Davidson dropped in
here to get something to eat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here comes the only moment in this story where
accident&mdash;mere accident&mdash;plays a part.&nbsp; If
Davidson had gone home that day for tiffin, there would be now,
after twelve years or more, nothing changed in his kindly, placid
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he came in here; and perhaps it was sitting at this
very table that he remarked to a friend of mine that his next
trip was to be a dollar-collecting trip.&nbsp; He added,
laughing, that his wife was making rather a fuss about it.&nbsp;
She had begged him to stay ashore and get somebody else to take
his place for a voyage.&nbsp; She thought there was some danger
on account of the dollars.&nbsp; He told her, he said, that there
were no Java-sea pirates nowadays except in boys&rsquo;
books.&nbsp; He had laughed at her fears, but he was very sorry,
too; for when she took any notion in her head it was impossible
to argue her out of it.&nbsp; She would be worrying herself all
the time he was away.&nbsp; Well, he couldn&rsquo;t help
it.&nbsp; There was no one ashore fit to take his place for the
trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This friend of mine and I went home together in the
same mail-boat, and he mentioned that conversation one evening in
the Red Sea while we were talking over the things and people we
had just left, with more or less regret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that Davidson occupied a very
prominent place.&nbsp; Moral excellence seldom does.&nbsp; He was
quietly appreciated by those who knew him well; but his more
obvious distinction consisted in this, that he was married.&nbsp;
Ours, as you remember, was a bachelor crowd; in spirit anyhow, if
not absolutely in fact.&nbsp; There might have been a few wives
in existence, but if so they were invisible, distant, never
alluded to.&nbsp; For what would have been the good?&nbsp;
Davidson alone was visibly married.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being married suited him exactly.&nbsp; It fitted him
so well that the wildest of us did not resent the fact when it
was disclosed.&nbsp; Directly he had felt his feet out here,
Davidson sent for his wife.&nbsp; She came out (from West
Australia) in the <i>Somerset</i>, under the care of Captain
Ritchie&mdash;you know, Monkey-face Ritchie&mdash;who
couldn&rsquo;t praise enough her sweetness, her gentleness, and
her charm.&nbsp; She seemed to be the heaven-born mate for
Davidson.&nbsp; She found on arrival a very pretty bungalow on
the hill, ready for her and the little girl they had.&nbsp; Very
soon he got for her a two-wheeled trap and a Burmah pony, and she
used to drive down of an evening to pick up Davidson, on the
quay.&nbsp; When Davidson, beaming, got into the trap, it would
become very full all at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We used to admire Mrs. Davidson from a distance.&nbsp;
It was a girlish head out of a keepsake.&nbsp; From a
distance.&nbsp; We had not many opportunities for a closer view,
because she did not care to give them to us.&nbsp; We would have
been glad to drop in at the Davidson bungalow, but we were made
to feel somehow that we were not very welcome there.&nbsp; Not
that she ever said anything ungracious.&nbsp; She never had much
to say for herself.&nbsp; I was perhaps the one who saw most of
the Davidsons at home.&nbsp; What I noticed under the superficial
aspect of vapid sweetness was her convex, obstinate forehead, and
her small, red, pretty, ungenerous mouth.&nbsp; But then I am an
observer with strong prejudices.&nbsp; Most of us were fetched by
her white, swan-like neck, by that drooping, innocent
profile.&nbsp; There was a lot of latent devotion to
Davidson&rsquo;s wife hereabouts, at that time, I can tell
you.&nbsp; But my idea was that she repaid it by a profound
suspicion of the sort of men we were; a mistrust which
extended&mdash;I fancied&mdash;to her very husband at
times.&nbsp; And I thought then she was jealous of him in a way;
though there were no women that she could be jealous about.&nbsp;
She had no women&rsquo;s society.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s difficult for
a shipmaster&rsquo;s wife unless there are other
shipmasters&rsquo; wives about, and there were none here
then.&nbsp; I know that the dock manager&rsquo;s wife called on
her; but that was all.&nbsp; The fellows here formed the opinion
that Mrs. Davidson was a meek, shy little thing.&nbsp; She looked
it, I must say.&nbsp; And this opinion was so universal that the
friend I have been telling you of remembered his conversation
with Davidson simply because of the statement about
Davidson&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; He even wondered to me: &lsquo;Fancy
Mrs. Davidson making a fuss to that extent.&nbsp; She
didn&rsquo;t seem to me the sort of woman that would know how to
make a fuss about anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wondered, too&mdash;but not so much.&nbsp; That bumpy
forehead&mdash;eh?&nbsp; I had always suspected her of being
silly.&nbsp; And I observed that Davidson must have been vexed by
this display of wifely anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend said: &lsquo;No.&nbsp; He seemed rather
touched and distressed.&nbsp; There really was no one he could
ask to relieve him; mainly because he intended to make a call in
some God-forsaken creek, to look up a fellow of the name of Bamtz
who apparently had settled there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And again my friend wondered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell
me,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;what connection can there be between
Davidson and such a creature as Bamtz?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember now what answer I made.&nbsp; A
sufficient one could have been given in two words:
&lsquo;Davidson&rsquo;s goodness.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>That</i> never
boggled at unworthiness if there was the slightest reason for
compassion.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want you to think that Davidson
had no discrimination at all.&nbsp; Bamtz could not have imposed
on him.&nbsp; Moreover, everybody knew what Bamtz was.&nbsp; He
was a loafer with a beard.&nbsp; When I think of Bamtz, the first
thing I see is that long black beard and a lot of propitiatory
wrinkles at the corners of two little eyes.&nbsp; There was no
such beard from here to Polynesia, where a beard is a valuable
property in itself.&nbsp; Bamtz&rsquo;s beard was valuable to him
in another way.&nbsp; You know how impressed Orientals are by a
fine beard.&nbsp; Years and years ago, I remember, the grave
Abdullah, the great trader of Sambir, unable to repress signs of
astonishment and admiration at the first sight of that imposing
beard.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s very well known that Bamtz lived on
Abdullah off and on for several years.&nbsp; It was a unique
beard, and so was the bearer of the same.&nbsp; A unique
loafer.&nbsp; He made a fine art of it, or rather a sort of craft
and mystery.&nbsp; One can understand a fellow living by cadging
and small swindles in towns, in large communities of people; but
Bamtz managed to do that trick in the wilderness, to loaf on the
outskirts of the virgin forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He understood how to ingratiate himself with the
natives.&nbsp; He would arrive in some settlement up a river,
make a present of a cheap carbine or a pair of shoddy binoculars,
or something of that sort, to the Rajah, or the head-man, or the
principal trader; and on the strength of that gift, ask for a
house, posing mysteriously as a very special trader.&nbsp; He
would spin them no end of yarns, live on the fat of the land, for
a while, and then do some mean swindle or other&mdash;or else
they would get tired of him and ask him to quit.&nbsp; And he
would go off meekly with an air of injured innocence.&nbsp; Funny
life.&nbsp; Yet, he never got hurt somehow.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
heard of the Rajah of Dongala giving him fifty dollars&rsquo;
worth of trade goods and paying his passage in a prau only to get
rid of him.&nbsp; Fact.&nbsp; And observe that nothing prevented
the old fellow having Bamtz&rsquo;s throat cut and the carcase
thrown into deep water outside the reefs; for who on earth would
have inquired after Bamtz?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had been known to loaf up and down the wilderness as
far north as the Gulf of Tonkin.&nbsp; Neither did he disdain a
spell of civilisation from time to time.&nbsp; And it was while
loafing and cadging in Saigon, bearded and dignified (he gave
himself out there as a bookkeeper), that he came across Laughing
Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The less said of her early history the better, but
something must be said.&nbsp; We may safely suppose there was
very little heart left in her famous laugh when Bamtz spoke first
to her in some low caf&eacute;.&nbsp; She was stranded in Saigon
with precious little money and in great trouble about a kid she
had, a boy of five or six.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fellow I just remember, whom they called Pearler
Harry, brought her out first into these parts&mdash;from
Australia, I believe.&nbsp; He brought her out and then dropped
her, and she remained knocking about here and there, known to
most of us by sight, at any rate.&nbsp; Everybody in the
Archipelago had heard of Laughing Anne.&nbsp; She had really a
pleasant silvery laugh always at her disposal, so to speak, but
it wasn&rsquo;t enough apparently to make her fortune.&nbsp; The
poor creature was ready to stick to any half-decent man if he
would only let her, but she always got dropped, as it might have
been expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had been left in Saigon by the skipper of a German
ship with whom she had been going up and down the China coast as
far as Vladivostok for near upon two years.&nbsp; The German said
to her: &lsquo;This is all over, <i>mein Taubchen</i>.&nbsp; I am
going home now to get married to the girl I got engaged to before
coming out here.&rsquo;&nbsp; And Anne said: &lsquo;All right,
I&rsquo;m ready to go.&nbsp; We part friends, don&rsquo;t
we?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was always anxious to part friends.&nbsp; The
German told her that of course they were parting friends.&nbsp;
He looked rather glum at the moment of parting.&nbsp; She laughed
and went ashore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was no laughing matter for her.&nbsp; She had
some notion that this would be her last chance.&nbsp; What
frightened her most was the future of her child.&nbsp; She had
left her boy in Saigon before going off with the German, in the
care of an elderly French couple.&nbsp; The husband was a
doorkeeper in some Government office, but his time was up, and
they were returning to France.&nbsp; She had to take the boy back
from them; and after she had got him back, she did not like to
part with him any more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the situation when she and Bamtz got
acquainted casually.&nbsp; She could not have had any illusions
about that fellow.&nbsp; To pick up with Bamtz was coming down
pretty low in the world, even from a material point of
view.&nbsp; She had always been decent, in her way; whereas Bamtz
was, not to mince words, an abject sort of creature.&nbsp; On the
other hand, that bearded loafer, who looked much more like a
pirate than a bookkeeper, was not a brute.&nbsp; He was
gentle&mdash;rather&mdash;even in his cups.&nbsp; And then,
despair, like misfortune, makes us acquainted with strange
bed-fellows.&nbsp; For she may well have despaired.&nbsp; She was
no longer young&mdash;you know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the man&rsquo;s side this conjunction is more
difficult to explain, perhaps.&nbsp; One thing, however, must be
said of Bamtz; he had always kept clear of native women.&nbsp; As
one can&rsquo;t suspect him of moral delicacy, I surmise that it
must have been from prudence.&nbsp; And he, too, was no longer
young.&nbsp; There were many white hairs in his valuable black
beard by then.&nbsp; He may have simply longed for some kind of
companionship in his queer, degraded existence.&nbsp; Whatever
their motives, they vanished from Saigon together.&nbsp; And of
course nobody cared what had become of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six months later Davidson came into the Mirrah
Settlement.&nbsp; It was the very first time he had been up that
creek, where no European vessel had ever been seen before.&nbsp;
A Javanese passenger he had on board offered him fifty dollars to
call in there&mdash;it must have been some very particular
business&mdash;and Davidson consented to try.&nbsp; Fifty
dollars, he told me, were neither here nor there; but he was
curious to see the place, and the little <i>Sissie</i> could go
anywhere where there was water enough to float a soup-plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson landed his Javanese plutocrat, and, as he had
to wait a couple of hours for the tide, he went ashore himself to
stretch his legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a small settlement.&nbsp; Some sixty houses,
most of them built on piles over the river, the rest scattered in
the long grass; the usual pathway at the back; the forest hemming
in the clearing and smothering what there might have been of air
into a dead, hot stagnation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the population was on the river-bank staring
silently, as Malays will do, at the <i>Sissie</i> anchored in the
stream.&nbsp; She was almost as wonderful to them as an
angel&rsquo;s visit.&nbsp; Many of the old people had only heard
vaguely of fire-ships, and not many of the younger generation had
seen one.&nbsp; On the back path Davidson strolled in perfect
solitude.&nbsp; But he became aware of a bad smell and concluded
he would go no farther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While he stood wiping his forehead, he heard from
somewhere the exclamation: &lsquo;My God!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
Davy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson&rsquo;s lower jaw, as he expressed it, came
unhooked at the crying of this excited voice.&nbsp; Davy was the
name used by the associates of his young days; he hadn&rsquo;t
heard it for many years.&nbsp; He stared about with his mouth
open and saw a white woman issue from the long grass in which a
small hut stood buried nearly up to the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to imagine the shock: in that wild place that you
couldn&rsquo;t find on a map, and more squalid than the most
poverty-stricken Malay settlement had a right to be, this
European woman coming swishing out of the long grass in a
fanciful tea-gown thing, dingy pink satin, with a long train and
frayed lace trimmings; her eyes like black coals in a pasty-white
face.&nbsp; Davidson thought that he was asleep, that he was
delirious.&nbsp; From the offensive village mudhole (it was what
Davidson had sniffed just before) a couple of filthy buffaloes
uprose with loud snorts and lumbered off crashing through the
bushes, panic-struck by this apparition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman came forward, her arms extended, and laid her
hands on Davidson&rsquo;s shoulders, exclaiming:
&lsquo;Why!&nbsp; You have hardly changed at all.&nbsp; The same
good Davy.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she laughed a little wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This sound was to Davidson like a galvanic shock to a
corpse.&nbsp; He started in every muscle.&nbsp; &lsquo;Laughing
Anne,&rsquo; he said in an awe-struck voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All that&rsquo;s left of her, Davy.&nbsp; All
that&rsquo;s left of her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson looked up at the sky; but there was to be seen
no balloon from which she could have fallen on that spot.&nbsp;
When he brought his distracted gaze down, it rested on a child
holding on with a brown little paw to the pink satin gown.&nbsp;
He had run out of the grass after her.&nbsp; Had Davidson seen a
real hobgoblin his eyes could not have bulged more than at this
small boy in a dirty white blouse and ragged knickers.&nbsp; He
had a round head of tight chestnut curls, very sunburnt legs, a
freckled face, and merry eyes.&nbsp; Admonished by his mother to
greet the gentleman, he finished off Davidson by addressing him
in French.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Bonjour</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson, overcome, looked up at the woman in
silence.&nbsp; She sent the child back to the hut, and when he
had disappeared in the grass, she turned to Davidson, tried to
speak, but after getting out the words, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s my
Tony,&rsquo; burst into a long fit of crying.&nbsp; She had to
lean on Davidson&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp; He, distressed in the
goodness of his heart, stood rooted to the spot where she had
come upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a meeting&mdash;eh?&nbsp; Bamtz had sent her out
to see what white man it was who had landed.&nbsp; And she had
recognised him from that time when Davidson, who had been
pearling himself in his youth, had been associating with Harry
the Pearler and others, the quietest of a rather rowdy set.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before Davidson retraced his steps to go on board the
steamer, he had heard much of Laughing Anne&rsquo;s story, and
had even had an interview, on the path, with Bamtz himself.&nbsp;
She ran back to the hut to fetch him, and he came out lounging,
with his hands in his pockets, with the detached, casual manner
under which he concealed his propensity to cringe.&nbsp;
Ya-a-as-as.&nbsp; He thought he would settle here
permanently&mdash;with her.&nbsp; This with a nod at Laughing
Anne, who stood by, a haggard, tragically anxious figure, her
black hair hanging over her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No more paint and dyes for me, Davy,&rsquo; she
struck in, &lsquo;if only you will do what he wants you to
do.&nbsp; You know that I was always ready to stand by my
men&mdash;if they had only let me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson had no doubt of her earnestness.&nbsp; It was
of Bamtz&rsquo;s good faith that he was not at all sure.&nbsp;
Bamtz wanted Davidson to promise to call at Mirrah more or less
regularly.&nbsp; He thought he saw an opening to do business with
rattans there, if only he could depend on some craft to bring out
trading goods and take away his produce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have a few dollars to make a start on.&nbsp;
The people are all right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had come there, where he was not known, in a native
prau, and had managed, with his sedate manner and the exactly
right kind of yarn he knew how to tell to the natives, to
ingratiate himself with the chief man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Orang Kaya has given me that empty house
there to live in as long as I will stay,&rsquo; added Bamtz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do it, Davy,&rsquo; cried the woman
suddenly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Think of that poor kid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Seen him?&nbsp; &rsquo;Cute little
customer,&rsquo; said the reformed loafer in such a tone of
interest as to surprise Davidson into a kindly glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I certainly can do it,&rsquo; he declared.&nbsp;
He thought of at first making some stipulation as to Bamtz
behaving decently to the woman, but his exaggerated delicacy and
also the conviction that such a fellow&rsquo;s promises were
worth nothing restrained him.&nbsp; Anne went a little distance
down the path with him talking anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s for the kid.&nbsp; How could I have
kept him with me if I had to knock about in towns?&nbsp; Here he
will never know that his mother was a painted woman.&nbsp; And
this Bamtz likes him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s real fond of him.&nbsp; I
suppose I ought to thank God for that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson shuddered at any human creature being brought
so low as to have to thank God for the favours or affection of a
Bamtz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And do you think that you can make out to live
here?&rsquo; he asked gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t I?&nbsp; You know I have always
stuck to men through thick and thin till they had enough of
me.&nbsp; And now look at me!&nbsp; But inside I am as I always
was.&nbsp; I have acted on the square to them all one after
another.&nbsp; Only they do get tired somehow.&nbsp; Oh,
Davy!&nbsp; Harry ought not to have cast me off.&nbsp; It was he
that led me astray.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson mentioned to her that Harry the Pearler had
been dead now for some years.&nbsp; Perhaps she had heard?</p>
<p>&ldquo;She made a sign that she had heard; and walked by the
side of Davidson in silence nearly to the bank.&nbsp; Then she
told him that her meeting with him had brought back the old times
to her mind.&nbsp; She had not cried for years.&nbsp; She was not
a crying woman either.&nbsp; It was hearing herself called
Laughing Anne that had started her sobbing like a fool.&nbsp;
Harry was the only man she had loved.&nbsp; The others&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shrugged her shoulders.&nbsp; But she prided
herself on her loyalty to the successive partners of her dismal
adventures.&nbsp; She had never played any tricks in her
life.&nbsp; She was a pal worth having.&nbsp; But men did get
tired.&nbsp; They did not understand women.&nbsp; She supposed it
had to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson was attempting a veiled warning as to Bamtz,
but she interrupted him.&nbsp; She knew what men were.&nbsp; She
knew what this man was like.&nbsp; But he had taken wonderfully
to the kid.&nbsp; And Davidson desisted willingly, saying to
himself that surely poor Laughing Anne could have no illusions by
this time.&nbsp; She wrung his hand hard at parting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s for the kid, Davy&mdash;it&rsquo;s
for the kid.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t he a bright little
chap?&rsquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>&ldquo;All this happened about two years before the day when
Davidson, sitting in this very room, talked to my friend.&nbsp;
You will see presently how this room can get full.&nbsp; Every
seat&rsquo;ll be occupied, and as you notice, the tables are set
close, so that the backs of the chairs are almost touching.&nbsp;
There is also a good deal of noisy talk here about one
o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose Davidson was talking very loudly;
but very likely he had to raise his voice across the table to my
friend.&nbsp; And here accident, mere accident, put in its work
by providing a pair of fine ears close behind Davidson&rsquo;s
chair.&nbsp; It was ten to one against, the owner of the same
having enough change in his pockets to get his tiffin here.&nbsp;
But he had.&nbsp; Most likely had rooked somebody of a few
dollars at cards overnight.&nbsp; He was a bright creature of the
name of Fector, a spare, short, jumpy fellow with a red face and
muddy eyes.&nbsp; He described himself as a journalist, as
certain kind of women give themselves out as actresses in the
dock of a police-court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He used to introduce himself to strangers as a man with
a mission to track out abuses and fight them whenever
found.&nbsp; He would also hint that he was a martyr.&nbsp; And
it&rsquo;s a fact that he had been kicked, horsewhipped,
imprisoned, and hounded with ignominy out of pretty well every
place between Ceylon and Shanghai, for a professional
blackmailer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose, in that trade, you&rsquo;ve got to have
active wits and sharp ears.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not likely that he
overheard every word Davidson said about his dollar collecting
trip, but he heard enough to set his wits at work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He let Davidson go out, and then hastened away down to
the native slums to a sort of lodging-house kept in partnership
by the usual sort of Portuguese and a very disreputable
Chinaman.&nbsp; Macao Hotel, it was called, but it was mostly a
gambling den that one used to warn fellows against.&nbsp; Perhaps
you remember?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, the evening before, Fector had met a precious
couple, a partnership even more queer than the Portuguese and the
Chinaman.&nbsp; One of the two was Niclaus&mdash;you know.&nbsp;
Why! the fellow with a Tartar moustache and a yellow complexion,
like a Mongolian, only that his eyes were set straight and his
face was not so flat.&nbsp; One couldn&rsquo;t tell what breed he
was.&nbsp; A nondescript beggar.&nbsp; From a certain angle you
would think a very bilious white man.&nbsp; And I daresay he
was.&nbsp; He owned a Malay prau and called himself The Nakhoda,
as one would say: The Captain.&nbsp; Aha!&nbsp; Now you
remember.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t, apparently, speak any other
European language than English, but he flew the Dutch flag on his
prau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other was the Frenchman without hands.&nbsp;
Yes.&nbsp; The very same we used to know in &rsquo;79 in Sydney,
keeping a little tobacco shop at the lower end of George
Street.&nbsp; You remember the huge carcase hunched up behind the
counter, the big white face and the long black hair brushed back
off a high forehead like a bard&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He was always
trying to roll cigarettes on his knee with his stumps, telling
endless yarns of Polynesia and whining and cursing in turn about
&lsquo;<i>mon malheur</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; His hands had been blown
away by a dynamite cartridge while fishing in some lagoon.&nbsp;
This accident, I believe, had made him more wicked than before,
which is saying a good deal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was always talking about &lsquo;resuming his
activities&rsquo; some day, whatever they were, if he could only
get an intelligent companion.&nbsp; It was evident that the
little shop was no field for his activities, and the sickly woman
with her face tied up, who used to look in sometimes through the
back door, was no companion for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, true enough, he vanished from Sydney before long,
after some trouble with the Excise fellows about his stock.&nbsp;
Goods stolen out of a warehouse or something similar.&nbsp; He
left the woman behind, but he must have secured some sort of
companion&mdash;he could not have shifted for himself; but whom
he went away with, and where, and what other companions he might
have picked up afterwards, it is impossible to make the remotest
guess about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why exactly he came this way I can&rsquo;t tell.&nbsp;
Towards the end of my time here we began to hear talk of a maimed
Frenchman who had been seen here and there.&nbsp; But no one knew
then that he had foregathered with Niclaus and lived in his
prau.&nbsp; I daresay he put Niclaus up to a thing or two.&nbsp;
Anyhow, it was a partnership.&nbsp; Niclaus was somewhat afraid
of the Frenchman on account of his tempers, which were
awful.&nbsp; He looked then like a devil; but a man without
hands, unable to load or handle a weapon, can at best go for one
only with his teeth.&nbsp; From that danger Niclaus felt certain
he could always defend himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The couple were alone together loafing in the
common-room of that infamous hotel when Fector turned up.&nbsp;
After some beating about the bush, for he was doubtful how far he
could trust these two, he repeated what he had overheard in the
tiffin-rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His tale did not have much success till he came to
mention the creek and Bamtz&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; Niclaus, sailing
about like a native in a prau, was, in his own words,
&lsquo;familiar with the locality.&rsquo;&nbsp; The huge
Frenchman, walking up and down the room with his stumps in the
pockets of his jacket, stopped short in surprise.&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>Comment</i>?&nbsp; <i>Bamtz</i>!&nbsp;
<i>Bamtz</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had run across him several times in his life.&nbsp;
He exclaimed: &lsquo;<i>Bamtz</i>!&nbsp; <i>Mais je ne connais
que ca</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; And he applied such a contemptuously
indecent epithet to Bamtz that when, later, he alluded to him as
&lsquo;<i>une chiffe</i>&rsquo; (a mere rag) it sounded quite
complimentary.&nbsp; &lsquo;We can do with him what we
like,&rsquo; he asserted confidently.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, yes.&nbsp;
Certainly we must hasten to pay a visit to that&mdash;&rsquo;
(another awful descriptive epithet quite unfit for
repetition).&nbsp; &lsquo;Devil take me if we don&rsquo;t pull
off a coup that will set us all up for a long time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He saw all that lot of dollars melted into bars and
disposed of somewhere on the China coast.&nbsp; Of the escape
after the <i>coup</i> he never doubted.&nbsp; There was
Niclaus&rsquo;s prau to manage that in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In his enthusiasm he pulled his stumps out of his
pockets and waved them about.&nbsp; Then, catching sight of them,
as it were, he held them in front of his eyes, cursing and
blaspheming and bewailing his misfortune and his helplessness,
till Niclaus quieted him down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was his mind that planned out the affair and it
was his spirit which carried the other two on.&nbsp; Neither of
them was of the bold buccaneer type; and Fector, especially, had
never in his adventurous life used other weapons than slander and
lies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That very evening they departed on a visit to Bamtz in
Niclaus&rsquo;s prau, which had been lying, emptied of her cargo
of cocoanuts, for a day or two under the canal bridge.&nbsp; They
must have crossed the bows of the anchored <i>Sissie</i>, and no
doubt looked at her with interest as the scene of their future
exploit, the great haul, <i>le grand coup</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson&rsquo;s wife, to his great surprise, sulked
with him for several days before he left.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know whether it occurred to him that, for all her angelic
profile, she was a very stupidly obstinate girl.&nbsp; She
didn&rsquo;t like the tropics.&nbsp; He had brought her out
there, where she had no friends, and now, she said, he was
becoming inconsiderate.&nbsp; She had a presentiment of some
misfortune, and notwithstanding Davidson&rsquo;s painstaking
explanations, she could not see why her presentiments were to be
disregarded.&nbsp; On the very last evening before Davidson went
away she asked him in a suspicious manner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why is it that you are so anxious to go this
time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am not anxious,&rsquo; protested the good
Davidson.&nbsp; &lsquo;I simply can&rsquo;t help myself.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s no one else to go in my place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no one,&rsquo; she said,
turning away slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was so distant with him that evening that Davidson
from a sense of delicacy made up his mind to say good-bye to her
at once and go and sleep on board.&nbsp; He felt very miserable
and, strangely enough, more on his own account than on account of
his wife.&nbsp; She seemed to him much more offended than
grieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three weeks later, having collected a good many cases
of old dollars (they were stowed aft in the lazarette with an
iron bar and a padlock securing the hatch under his cabin-table),
yes, with a bigger lot than he had expected to collect, he found
himself homeward bound and off the entrance of the creek where
Bamtz lived and even, in a sense, flourished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was so late in the day that Davidson actually
hesitated whether he should not pass by this time.&nbsp; He had
no regard for Bamtz, who was a degraded but not a really unhappy
man.&nbsp; His pity for Laughing Anne was no more than her case
deserved.&nbsp; But his goodness was of a particularly delicate
sort.&nbsp; He realised how these people were dependent on him,
and how they would feel their dependence (if he failed to turn
up) through a long month of anxious waiting.&nbsp; Prompted by
his sensitive humanity, Davidson, in the gathering dusk, turned
the <i>Sissie&rsquo;s</i> head towards the hardly discernible
coast, and navigated her safety through a maze of shallow
patches.&nbsp; But by the time he got to the mouth of the creek
the night had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The narrow waterway lay like a black cutting through
the forest.&nbsp; And as there were always grounded snaggs in the
channel which it would be impossible to make out, Davidson very
prudently turned the <i>Sissie</i> round, and with only enough
steam on the boilers to give her a touch ahead if necessary, let
her drift up stern first with the tide, silent and invisible in
the impenetrable darkness and in the dumb stillness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a long job, and when at the end of two hours
Davidson thought he must be up to the clearing, the settlement
slept already, the whole land of forests and rivers was
asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson, seeing a solitary light in the massed
darkness of the shore, knew that it was burning in Bamtz&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; This was unexpected at this time of the night, but
convenient as a guide.&nbsp; By a turn of the screw and a touch
of the helm he sheered the <i>Sissie</i> alongside Bamtz&rsquo;s
wharf&mdash;a miserable structure of a dozen piles and a few
planks, of which the ex-vagabond was very proud.&nbsp; A couple
of Kalashes jumped down on it, took a turn with the ropes thrown
to them round the posts, and the <i>Sissie</i> came to rest
without a single loud word or the slightest noise.&nbsp; And just
in time too, for the tide turned even before she was properly
moored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson had something to eat, and then, coming on deck
for a last look round, noticed that the light was still burning
in the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was very unusual, but since they were awake so
late, Davidson thought that he would go up to say that he was in
a hurry to be off and to ask that what rattans there were in
store should be sent on board with the first sign of dawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stepped carefully over the shaky planks, not being
anxious to get a sprained ankle, and picked his way across the
waste ground to the foot of the house ladder.&nbsp; The house was
but a glorified hut on piles, unfenced and lonely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like many a stout man, Davidson is very
lightfooted.&nbsp; He climbed the seven steps or so, stepped
across the bamboo platform quietly, but what he saw through the
doorway stopped him short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four men were sitting by the light of a solitary
candle.&nbsp; There was a bottle, a jug and glasses on the table,
but they were not engaged in drinking.&nbsp; Two packs of cards
were lying there too, but they were not preparing to play.&nbsp;
They were talking together in whispers, and remained quite
unaware of him.&nbsp; He himself was too astonished to make a
sound for some time.&nbsp; The world was still, except for the
sibilation of the whispering heads bunched together over the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Davidson, as I have quoted him to you before,
didn&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t like it at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The situation ended with a scream proceeding from the
dark, interior part of the room.&nbsp; &lsquo;O Davy!
you&rsquo;ve given me a turn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson made out beyond the table Anne&rsquo;s very
pale face.&nbsp; She laughed a little hysterically, out of the
deep shadows between the gloomy mat walls.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ha! ha!
ha!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The four heads sprang apart at the first sound, and
four pairs of eyes became fixed stonily on Davidson.&nbsp; The
woman came forward, having little more on her than a loose chintz
wrapper and straw slippers on her bare feet.&nbsp; Her head was
tied up Malay fashion in a red handkerchief, with a mass of loose
hair hanging under it behind.&nbsp; Her professional, gay,
European feathers had literally dropped off her in the course of
these two years, but a long necklace of amber beads hung round
her uncovered neck.&nbsp; It was the only ornament she had left;
Bamtz had sold all her poor-enough trinkets during the flight
from Saigon&mdash;when their association began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She came forward, past the table, into the light, with
her usual groping gesture of extended arms, as though her soul,
poor thing! had gone blind long ago, her white cheeks hollow, her
eyes darkly wild, distracted, as Davidson thought.&nbsp; She came
on swiftly, grabbed him by the arm, dragged him in.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s heaven itself that sends you to-night.&nbsp; My
Tony&rsquo;s so bad&mdash;come and see him.&nbsp; Come
along&mdash;do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson submitted.&nbsp; The only one of the men to
move was Bamtz, who made as if to get up but dropped back in his
chair again.&nbsp; Davidson in passing heard him mutter
confusedly something that sounded like &lsquo;poor little
beggar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The child, lying very flushed in a miserable cot
knocked up out of gin-cases, stared at Davidson with wide, drowsy
eyes.&nbsp; It was a bad bout of fever clearly.&nbsp; But while
Davidson was promising to go on board and fetch some medicines,
and generally trying to say reassuring things, he could not help
being struck by the extraordinary manner of the woman standing by
his side.&nbsp; Gazing with despairing expression down at the
cot, she would suddenly throw a quick, startled glance at
Davidson and then towards the other room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, my poor girl,&rsquo; he whispered,
interpreting her distraction in his own way, though he had
nothing precise in his mind.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid this
bodes no good to you.&nbsp; How is it they are here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seized his forearm and breathed out forcibly:
&lsquo;No good to me!&nbsp; Oh, no!&nbsp; But what about
you!&nbsp; They are after the dollars you have on
board.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson let out an astonished &lsquo;How do they know
there are any dollars?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She clapped her hands lightly, in distress.&nbsp;
&lsquo;So it&rsquo;s true!&nbsp; You have them on board?&nbsp;
Then look out for yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They stood gazing down at the boy in the cot, aware
that they might be observed from the other room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We must get him to perspire as soon as
possible,&rsquo; said Davidson in his ordinary voice.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have to give him hot drink of some
kind.&nbsp; I will go on board and bring you a spirit-kettle
amongst other things.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he added under his breath:
&lsquo;Do they actually mean murder?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She made no sign, she had returned to her desolate
contemplation of the boy.&nbsp; Davidson thought she had not
heard him even, when with an unchanged expression she spoke under
her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Frenchman would, in a minute.&nbsp; The
others shirk it&mdash;unless you resist.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a
devil.&nbsp; He keeps them going.&nbsp; Without him they would
have done nothing but talk.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got chummy with him.
What can you do when you are with a man like the fellow I am with
now.&nbsp; Bamtz is terrified of them, and they know it.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s in it from funk.&nbsp; Oh, Davy! take your ship
away&mdash;quick!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Too late,&rsquo; said Davidson.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She&rsquo;s on the mud already.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the kid hadn&rsquo;t been in this state I would have
run off with him&mdash;to you&mdash;into the
woods&mdash;anywhere.&nbsp; Oh, Davy! will he die?&rsquo; she
cried aloud suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson met three men in the doorway.&nbsp; They made
way for him without actually daring to face his glance.&nbsp; But
Bamtz was the only one who looked down with an air of
guilt.&nbsp; The big Frenchman had remained lolling in his chair;
he kept his stumps in his pockets and addressed Davidson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it unfortunate about that
child!&nbsp; The distress of that woman there upsets me, but I am
of no use in the world.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t smooth the sick
pillow of my dearest friend.&nbsp; I have no hands.&nbsp; Would
you mind sticking one of those cigarettes there into the mouth of
a poor, harmless cripple?&nbsp; My nerves want
soothing&mdash;upon my honour, they do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson complied with his naturally kind smile.&nbsp;
As his outward placidity becomes only more pronounced, if
possible, the more reason there is for excitement; and as
Davidson&rsquo;s eyes, when his wits are hard at work, get very
still and as if sleepy, the huge Frenchman might have been
justified in concluding that the man there was a mere
sheep&mdash;a sheep ready for slaughter.&nbsp; With a
&lsquo;<i>merci bien</i>&rsquo; he uplifted his huge carcase to
reach the light of the candle with his cigarette, and Davidson
left the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going down to the ship and returning, he had time to
consider his position.&nbsp; At first he was inclined to believe
that these men (Niclaus&mdash;the white Nakhoda&mdash;was the
only one he knew by sight before, besides Bamtz) were not of the
stamp to proceed to extremities.&nbsp; This was partly the reason
why he never attempted to take any measures on board.&nbsp; His
pacific Kalashes were not to be thought of as against white
men.&nbsp; His wretched engineer would have had a fit from fright
at the mere idea of any sort of combat.&nbsp; Davidson knew that
he would have to depend on himself in this affair if it ever came
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson underestimated naturally the driving power of
the Frenchman&rsquo;s character and the force of the actuating
motive.&nbsp; To that man so hopelessly crippled these dollars
were an enormous opportunity.&nbsp; With his share of the robbery
he would open another shop in Vladivostok, Ha&iuml;phong,
Manila&mdash;somewhere far away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither did it occur to Davidson, who is a man of
courage, if ever there was one, that his psychology was not known
to the world at large, and that to this particular lot of
ruffians, who judged him by his appearance, he appeared an
unsuspicious, inoffensive, soft creature, as he passed again
through the room, his hands full of various objects and parcels
destined for the sick boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the four were sitting again round the table.&nbsp;
Bamtz not having the pluck to open his mouth, it was Niclaus who,
as a collective voice, called out to him thickly to come out soon
and join in a drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I think I&rsquo;ll have to stay some little time
in there, to help her look after the boy,&rsquo; Davidson
answered without stopping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was a good thing to say to allay a possible
suspicion.&nbsp; And, as it was, Davidson felt he must not stay
very long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sat down on an old empty nail-keg near the
improvised cot and looked at the child; while Laughing Anne,
moving to and fro, preparing the hot drink, giving it to the boy
in spoonfuls, or stopping to gaze motionless at the flushed face,
whispered disjointed bits of information.&nbsp; She had succeeded
in making friends with that French devil.&nbsp; Davy would
understand that she knew how to make herself pleasant to a
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Davidson nodded without looking at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The big beast had got to be quite confidential with
her.&nbsp; She held his cards for him when they were having a
game.&nbsp; Bamtz!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Bamtz in his funk was only too
glad to see the Frenchman humoured.&nbsp; And the Frenchman had
come to believe that she was a woman who didn&rsquo;t care what
she did.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how it came about they got to talk
before her openly.&nbsp; For a long time she could not make out
what game they were up to.&nbsp; The new arrivals, not expecting
to find a woman with Bamtz, had been very startled and annoyed at
first, she explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She busied herself in attending to the boy; and nobody
looking into that room would have seen anything suspicious in
those two people exchanging murmurs by the sick-bedside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But now they think I am a better man than Bamtz
ever was,&rsquo; she said with a faint laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The child moaned.&nbsp; She went down on her knees,
and, bending low, contemplated him mournfully.&nbsp; Then raising
her head, she asked Davidson whether he thought the child would
get better.&nbsp; Davidson was sure of it.&nbsp; She murmured
sadly: &lsquo;Poor kid.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing in life for
such as he.&nbsp; Not a dog&rsquo;s chance.&nbsp; But I
couldn&rsquo;t let him go, Davy!&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson felt a profound pity for the child.&nbsp; She
laid her hand on his knee and whispered an earnest warning
against the Frenchman.&nbsp; Davy must never let him come to
close quarters.&nbsp; Naturally Davidson wanted to know the
reason, for a man without hands did not strike him as very
formidable under any circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mind you don&rsquo;t let him&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all,&rsquo; she insisted anxiously, hesitated, and then confessed
that the Frenchman had got her away from the others that
afternoon and had ordered her to tie a seven-pound iron weight
(out of the set of weights Bamtz used in business) to his right
stump.&nbsp; She had to do it for him.&nbsp; She had been afraid
of his savage temper.&nbsp; Bamtz was such a craven, and neither
of the other men would have cared what happened to her.&nbsp; The
Frenchman, however, with many awful threats had warned her not to
let the others know what she had done for him.&nbsp; Afterwards
he had been trying to cajole her.&nbsp; He had promised her that
if she stood by him faithfully in this business he would take her
with him to Ha&iuml;phong or some other place.&nbsp; A poor
cripple needed somebody to take care of him&mdash;always.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson asked her again if they really meant
mischief.&nbsp; It was, he told me, the hardest thing to believe
he had run up against, as yet, in his life.&nbsp; Anne
nodded.&nbsp; The Frenchman&rsquo;s heart was set on this
robbery.&nbsp; Davy might expect them, about midnight, creeping
on board his ship, to steal anyhow&mdash;to murder,
perhaps.&nbsp; Her voice sounded weary, and her eyes remained
fastened on her child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And still Davidson could not accept it somehow; his
contempt for these men was too great.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look here, Davy,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go outside with them when they start, and it
will be hard luck if I don&rsquo;t find something to laugh
at.&nbsp; They are used to that from me.&nbsp; Laugh or
cry&mdash;what&rsquo;s the odds.&nbsp; You will be able to hear
me on board on this quiet night.&nbsp; Dark it is too.&nbsp; Oh!
it&rsquo;s dark, Davy!&mdash;it&rsquo;s dark!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you run any risks,&rsquo; said
Davidson.&nbsp; Presently he called her attention to the boy,
who, less flushed now, had dropped into a sound sleep.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Look.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be all right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She made as if to snatch the child up to her breast,
but restrained herself.&nbsp; Davidson prepared to go.&nbsp; She
whispered hurriedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mind, Davy!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve told them that you
generally sleep aft in the hammock under the awning over the
cabin.&nbsp; They have been asking me about your ways and about
your ship, too.&nbsp; I told them all I knew.&nbsp; I had to keep
in with them.&nbsp; And Bamtz would have told them if I
hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;you understand?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made a friendly sign and went out.&nbsp; The men
about the table (except Bamtz) looked at him.&nbsp; This time it
was Fector who spoke.&nbsp; &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you join us in a
quiet game, Captain?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson said that now the child was better he thought
he would go on board and turn in.&nbsp; Fector was the only one
of the four whom he had, so to speak, never seen, for he had had
a good look at the Frenchman already.&nbsp; He observed
Fector&rsquo;s muddy eyes, his mean, bitter mouth.&nbsp;
Davidson&rsquo;s contempt for those men rose in his gorge, while
his placid smile, his gentle tones and general air of innocence
put heart into them.&nbsp; They exchanged meaning glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We shall be sitting late over the cards,&rsquo;
Fector said in his harsh, low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t make more noise than you can
help.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! we are a quiet lot.&nbsp; And if the invalid
shouldn&rsquo;t be so well, she will be sure to send one of us
down to call you, so that you may play the doctor again.&nbsp; So
don&rsquo;t shoot at sight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He isn&rsquo;t a shooting man,&rsquo; struck in
Niclaus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I never shoot before making sure there&rsquo;s a
reason for it&mdash;at any rate,&rsquo; said Davidson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bamtz let out a sickly snigger.&nbsp; The Frenchman
alone got up to make a bow to Davidson&rsquo;s careless
nod.&nbsp; His stumps were stuck immovably in his pockets.&nbsp;
Davidson understood now the reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went down to the ship.&nbsp; His wits were working
actively, and he was thoroughly angry.&nbsp; He smiled, he says
(it must have been the first grim smile of his life), at the
thought of the seven-pound weight lashed to the end of the
Frenchman&rsquo;s stump.&nbsp; The ruffian had taken that
precaution in case of a quarrel that might arise over the
division of the spoil.&nbsp; A man with an unsuspected power to
deal killing blows could take his own part in a sudden scrimmage
round a heap of money, even against adversaries armed with
revolvers, especially if he himself started the row.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s ready to face any of his friends with
that thing.&nbsp; But he will have no use for it.&nbsp; There
will be no occasion to quarrel about these dollars here,&rsquo;
thought Davidson, getting on board quietly.&nbsp; He never paused
to look if there was anybody about the decks.&nbsp; As a matter
of fact, most of his crew were on shore, and the rest slept,
stowed away in dark corners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had his plan, and he went to work methodically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He fetched a lot of clothing from below and disposed it
in his hammock in such a way as to distend it to the shape of a
human body; then he threw over all the light cotton sheet he used
to draw over himself when sleeping on deck.&nbsp; Having done
this, he loaded his two revolvers and clambered into one of the
boats the <i>Sissie</i> carried right aft, swung out on their
davits.&nbsp; Then he waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And again the doubt of such a thing happening to him
crept into his mind.&nbsp; He was almost ashamed of this
ridiculous vigil in a boat.&nbsp; He became bored.&nbsp; And then
he became drowsy.&nbsp; The stillness of the black universe
wearied him.&nbsp; There was not even the lapping of the water to
keep him company, for the tide was out and the <i>Sissie</i> was
lying on soft mud.&nbsp; Suddenly in the breathless, soundless,
hot night an argus pheasant screamed in the woods across the
stream.&nbsp; Davidson started violently, all his senses on the
alert at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The candle was still burning in the house.&nbsp;
Everything was quiet again, but Davidson felt drowsy no
longer.&nbsp; An uneasy premonition of evil oppressed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Surely I am not afraid,&rsquo; he argued with
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The silence was like a seal on his ears, and his
nervous inward impatience grew intolerable.&nbsp; He commanded
himself to keep still.&nbsp; But all the same he was just going
to jump out of the boat when a faint ripple on the immensity of
silence, a mere tremor in the air, the ghost of a silvery laugh,
reached his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Illusion!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He kept very still.&nbsp; He had no difficulty now in
emulating the stillness of the mouse&mdash;a grimly determined
mouse.&nbsp; But he could not shake off that premonition of evil
unrelated to the mere danger of the situation.&nbsp; Nothing
happened.&nbsp; It had been an illusion!</p>
<p>&ldquo;A curiosity came to him to learn how they would go to
work.&nbsp; He wondered and wondered, till the whole thing seemed
more absurd than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had left the hanging lamp in the cabin burning as
usual.&nbsp; It was part of his plan that everything should be as
usual.&nbsp; Suddenly in the dim glow of the skylight panes a
bulky shadow came up the ladder without a sound, made two steps
towards the hammock (it hung right over the skylight), and stood
motionless.&nbsp; The Frenchman!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The minutes began to slip away.&nbsp; Davidson guessed
that the Frenchman&rsquo;s part (the poor cripple) was to watch
his (Davidson&rsquo;s) slumbers while the others were no doubt in
the cabin busy forcing off the lazarette hatch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the course they meant to pursue once they got
hold of the silver (there were ten cases, and each could be
carried easily by two men) nobody can tell now.&nbsp; But so far,
Davidson was right.&nbsp; They were in the cabin.&nbsp; He
expected to hear the sounds of breaking-in every moment.&nbsp;
But the fact was that one of them (perhaps Fector, who had stolen
papers out of desks in his time) knew how to pick a lock, and
apparently was provided with the tools.&nbsp; Thus while Davidson
expected every moment to hear them begin down there, they had the
bar off already and two cases actually up in the cabin out of the
lazarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the diffused faint glow of the skylight the
Frenchman moved no more than a statue.&nbsp; Davidson could have
shot him with the greatest ease&mdash;but he was not homicidally
inclined.&nbsp; Moreover, he wanted to make sure before opening
fire that the others had gone to work.&nbsp; Not hearing the
sounds he expected to hear, he felt uncertain whether they all
were on board yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While he listened, the Frenchman, whose immobility
might have but cloaked an internal struggle; moved forward a
pace, then another.&nbsp; Davidson, entranced, watched him
advance one leg, withdraw his right stump, the armed one, out of
his pocket, and swinging his body to put greater force into the
blow, bring the seven-pound weight down on the hammock where the
head of the sleeper ought to have been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson admitted to me that his hair stirred at the
roots then.&nbsp; But for Anne, his unsuspecting head would have
been there.&nbsp; The Frenchman&rsquo;s surprise must have been
simply overwhelming.&nbsp; He staggered away from the lightly
swinging hammock, and before Davidson could make a movement he
had vanished, bounding down the ladder to warn and alarm the
other fellows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson sprang instantly out of the boat, threw up the
skylight flap, and had a glimpse of the men down there crouching
round the hatch.&nbsp; They looked up scared, and at that moment
the Frenchman outside the door bellowed out
&lsquo;<i>Trahison</i>&mdash;<i>trahison</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; They
bolted out of the cabin, falling over each other and swearing
awfully.&nbsp; The shot Davidson let off down the skylight had
hit no one; but he ran to the edge of the cabin-top and at once
opened fire at the dark shapes rushing about the deck.&nbsp;
These shots were returned, and a rapid fusillade burst out,
reports and flashes, Davidson dodging behind a ventilator and
pulling the trigger till his revolver clicked, and then throwing
it down to take the other in his right hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had been hearing in the din the Frenchman&rsquo;s
infuriated yells &lsquo;<i>Tuez-le</i>! <i>tuez-le</i>!&rsquo;
above the fierce cursing of the others.&nbsp; But though they
fired at him they were only thinking of clearing out.&nbsp; In
the flashes of the last shots Davidson saw them scrambling over
the rail.&nbsp; That he had hit more than one he was
certain.&nbsp; Two different voices had cried out in pain.&nbsp;
But apparently none of them were disabled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson leaned against the bulwark reloading his
revolver without haste.&nbsp; He had not the slightest
apprehension of their coming back.&nbsp; On the other hand, he
had no intention of pursuing them on shore in the dark.&nbsp;
What they were doing he had no idea.&nbsp; Looking to their hurts
probably.&nbsp; Not very far from the bank the invisible
Frenchman was blaspheming and cursing his associates, his luck,
and all the world.&nbsp; He ceased; then with a sudden, vengeful
yell, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s that woman!&mdash;it&rsquo;s that woman
that has sold us,&rsquo; was heard running off in the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson caught his breath in a sudden pang of
remorse.&nbsp; He perceived with dismay that the stratagem of his
defence had given Anne away.&nbsp; He did not hesitate a
moment.&nbsp; It was for him to save her now.&nbsp; He leaped
ashore.&nbsp; But even as he landed on the wharf he heard a
shrill shriek which pierced his very soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The light was still burning in the house.&nbsp;
Davidson, revolver in hand, was making for it when another
shriek, away to his left, made him change his direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He changed his direction&mdash;but very soon he
stopped.&nbsp; It was then that he hesitated in cruel
perplexity.&nbsp; He guessed what had happened.&nbsp; The woman
had managed to escape from the house in some way, and now was
being chased in the open by the infuriated Frenchman.&nbsp; He
trusted she would try to run on board for protection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All was still around Davidson.&nbsp; Whether she had
run on board or not, this silence meant that the Frenchman had
lost her in the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson, relieved, but still very anxious, turned
towards the river-side.&nbsp; He had not made two steps in that
direction when another shriek burst out behind him, again close
to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks that the Frenchman had lost sight of the poor
woman right enough.&nbsp; Then came that period of silence.&nbsp;
But the horrible ruffian had not given up his murderous
purpose.&nbsp; He reasoned that she would try to steal back to
her child, and went to lie in wait for her near the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been something like that.&nbsp; As she
entered the light falling about the house-ladder, he had rushed
at her too soon, impatient for vengeance.&nbsp; She had let out
that second scream of mortal fear when she caught sight of him,
and turned to run for life again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time she was making for the river, but not in a
straight line.&nbsp; Her shrieks circled about Davidson.&nbsp; He
turned on his heels, following the horrible trail of sound in the
darkness.&nbsp; He wanted to shout &lsquo;This way, Anne!&nbsp; I
am here!&rsquo; but he couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; At the horror of
this chase, more ghastly in his imagination than if he could have
seen it, the perspiration broke out on his forehead, while his
throat was as dry as tinder.&nbsp; A last supreme scream was cut
short suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The silence which ensued was even more dreadful.&nbsp;
Davidson felt sick.&nbsp; He tore his feet from the spot and
walked straight before him, gripping the revolver and peering
into the obscurity fearfully.&nbsp; Suddenly a bulky shape sprang
from the ground within a few yards of him and bounded away.&nbsp;
Instinctively he fired at it, started to run in pursuit, and
stumbled against something soft which threw him down
headlong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even as he pitched forward on his head he knew it could
be nothing else but Laughing Anne&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; He picked
himself up and, remaining on his knees, tried to lift her in his
arms.&nbsp; He felt her so limp that he gave it up.&nbsp; She was
lying on her face, her long hair scattered on the ground.&nbsp;
Some of it was wet.&nbsp; Davidson, feeling about her head, came
to a place where the crushed bone gave way under his
fingers.&nbsp; But even before that discovery he knew that she
was dead.&nbsp; The pursuing Frenchman had flung her down with a
kick from behind, and, squatting on her back, was battering in
her skull with the weight she herself had fastened to his stump,
when the totally unexpected Davidson loomed up in the night and
scared him away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson, kneeling by the side of that woman done so
miserably to death, was overcome by remorse.&nbsp; She had died
for him.&nbsp; His manhood was as if stunned.&nbsp; For the first
time he felt afraid.&nbsp; He might have been pounced upon in the
dark at any moment by the murderer of Laughing Anne.&nbsp; He
confesses to the impulse of creeping away from that pitiful
corpse on his hands and knees to the refuge of the ship.&nbsp; He
even says that he actually began to do so. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;One can hardly picture to oneself Davidson crawling
away on all fours from the murdered woman&mdash;Davidson unmanned
and crushed by the idea that she had died for him in a
sense.&nbsp; But he could not have gone very far.&nbsp; What
stopped him was the thought of the boy, Laughing Anne&rsquo;s
child, that (Davidson remembered her very words) would not have a
dog&rsquo;s chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This life the woman had left behind her appeared to
Davidson&rsquo;s conscience in the light of a sacred trust.&nbsp;
He assumed an erect attitude and, quaking inwardly still, turned
about and walked towards the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all his tremors he was very determined; but that
smashed skull had affected his imagination, and he felt very
defenceless in the darkness, in which he seemed to hear faintly
now here, now there, the prowling footsteps of the murderer
without hands.&nbsp; But he never faltered in his purpose.&nbsp;
He got away with the boy safely after all.&nbsp; The house he
found empty.&nbsp; A profound silence encompassed him all the
time, except once, just as he got down the ladder with Tony in
his arms, when a faint groan reached his ears.&nbsp; It seemed to
come from the pitch-black space between the posts on which the
house was built, but he did not stop to investigate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use telling you in detail how Davidson
got on board with the burden Anne&rsquo;s miserably cruel fate
had thrust into his arms; how next morning his scared crew, after
observing from a distance the state of affairs on board, rejoined
with alacrity; how Davidson went ashore and, aided by his
engineer (still half dead with fright), rolled up Laughing
Anne&rsquo;s body in a cotton sheet and brought it on board for
burial at sea later.&nbsp; While busy with this pious task,
Davidson, glancing about, perceived a huge heap of white clothes
huddled up against the corner-post of the house.&nbsp; That it
was the Frenchman lying there he could not doubt.&nbsp; Taking it
in connection with the dismal groan he had heard in the night,
Davidson is pretty sure that his random shot gave a mortal hurt
to the murderer of poor Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the others, Davidson never set eyes on a single
one of them.&nbsp; Whether they had concealed themselves in the
scared settlement, or bolted into the forest, or were hiding on
board Niclaus&rsquo;s prau, which could be seen lying on the mud
a hundred yards or so higher up the creek, the fact is that they
vanished; and Davidson did not trouble his head about them.&nbsp;
He lost no time in getting out of the creek directly the
<i>Sissie</i> floated.&nbsp; After steaming some twenty miles
clear of the coast, he (in his own words) &lsquo;committed the
body to the deep.&rsquo;&nbsp; He did everything himself.&nbsp;
He weighted her down with a few fire-bars, he read the service,
he lifted the plank, he was the only mourner.&nbsp; And while he
was rendering these last services to the dead, the desolation of
that life and the atrocious wretchedness of its end cried aloud
to his compassion, whispered to him in tones of
self-reproach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to have handled the warning she had given him
in another way.&nbsp; He was convinced now that a simple display
of watchfulness would have been enough to restrain that vile and
cowardly crew.&nbsp; But the fact was that he had not quite
believed that anything would be attempted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The body of Laughing Anne having been &lsquo;committed
to the deep&rsquo; some twenty miles S.S.W. from Cape Selatan,
the task before Davidson was to commit Laughing Anne&rsquo;s
child to the care of his wife.&nbsp; And there poor, good
Davidson made a fatal move.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t want to tell
her the whole awful story, since it involved the knowledge of the
danger from which he, Davidson, had escaped.&nbsp; And this, too,
after he had been laughing at her unreasonable fears only a short
time before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I thought that if I told her everything,&rsquo;
Davidson explained to me, &lsquo;she would never have a
moment&rsquo;s peace while I was away on my trips.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He simply stated that the boy was an orphan, the child
of some people to whom he, Davidson, was under the greatest
obligation, and that he felt morally bound to look after
him.&nbsp; Some day he would tell her more, he said, and meantime
he trusted in the goodness and warmth of her heart, in her
woman&rsquo;s natural compassion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not know that her heart was about the size of a
parched pea, and had the proportional amount of warmth; and that
her faculty of compassion was mainly directed to herself.&nbsp;
He was only startled and disappointed at the air of cold surprise
and the suspicious look with which she received his imperfect
tale.&nbsp; But she did not say much.&nbsp; She never had much to
say.&nbsp; She was a fool of the silent, hopeless kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What story Davidson&rsquo;s crew thought fit to set
afloat in Malay town is neither here nor there.&nbsp; Davidson
himself took some of his friends into his confidence, besides
giving the full story officially to the Harbour Master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Harbour Master was considerably astonished.&nbsp;
He didn&rsquo;t think, however, that a formal complaint should be
made to the Dutch Government.&nbsp; They would probably do
nothing in the end, after a lot of trouble and
correspondence.&nbsp; The robbery had not come off, after
all.&nbsp; Those vagabonds could be trusted to go to the devil in
their own way.&nbsp; No amount of fuss would bring the poor woman
to life again, and the actual murderer had been done justice to
by a chance shot from Davidson.&nbsp; Better let the matter
drop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was good common sense.&nbsp; But he was
impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sounds a terrible affair, Captain
Davidson.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Aye, terrible enough,&rsquo; agreed the
remorseful Davidson.&nbsp; But the most terrible thing for him,
though he didn&rsquo;t know it yet then, was that his
wife&rsquo;s silly brain was slowly coming to the conclusion that
Tony was Davidson&rsquo;s child, and that he had invented that
lame story to introduce him into her pure home in defiance of
decency, of virtue&mdash;of her most sacred feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson was aware of some constraint in his domestic
relations.&nbsp; But at the best of times she was not
demonstrative; and perhaps that very coldness was part of her
charm in the placid Davidson&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; Women are loved
for all sorts of reasons and even for characteristics which one
would think repellent.&nbsp; She was watching him and nursing her
suspicions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, one day, Monkey-faced Ritchie called on that
sweet, shy Mrs. Davidson.&nbsp; She had come out under his care,
and he considered himself a privileged person&mdash;her oldest
friend in the tropics.&nbsp; He posed for a great admirer of
hers.&nbsp; He was always a great chatterer.&nbsp; He had got
hold of the story rather vaguely, and he started chattering on
that subject, thinking she knew all about it.&nbsp; And in due
course he let out something about Laughing Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Laughing Anne,&rsquo; says Mrs. Davidson with a
start.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ritchie plunged into circumlocution at once, but she
very soon stopped him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is that creature dead?&rsquo;
she asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I believe so,&rsquo; stammered Ritchie.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Your husband says so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But you don&rsquo;t know for certain?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No!&nbsp; How could I, Mrs. Davidson!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all wanted to know,&rsquo; says
she, and goes out of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Davidson came home she was ready to go for him,
not with common voluble indignation, but as if trickling a stream
of cold clear water down his back.&nbsp; She talked of his base
intrigue with a vile woman, of being made a fool of, of the
insult to her dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson begged her to listen to him and told her all
the story, thinking that it would move a heart of stone.&nbsp; He
tried to make her understand his remorse.&nbsp; She heard him to
the end, said &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; and turned her back on
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe me?&rsquo; he asked,
appalled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t say yes or no.&nbsp; All she said was,
&lsquo;Send that brat away at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t throw him out into the
street,&rsquo; cried Davidson.&nbsp; &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; There are charitable
institutions for such children, I suppose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That I will never do,&rsquo; said Davidson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very well.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s enough for
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson&rsquo;s home after this was like a silent,
frozen hell for him.&nbsp; A stupid woman with a sense of
grievance is worse than an unchained devil.&nbsp; He sent the boy
to the White Fathers in Malacca.&nbsp; This was not a very
expensive sort of education, but she could not forgive him for
not casting the offensive child away utterly.&nbsp; She worked up
her sense of her wifely wrongs and of her injured purity to such
a pitch that one day, when poor Davidson was pleading with her to
be reasonable and not to make an impossible existence for them
both, she turned on him in a chill passion and told him that his
very sight was odious to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davidson, with his scrupulous delicacy of feeling, was
not the man to assert his rights over a woman who could not bear
the sight of him.&nbsp; He bowed his head; and shortly afterwards
arranged for her to go back to her parents.&nbsp; That was
exactly what she wanted in her outraged dignity.&nbsp; And then
she had always disliked the tropics and had detested secretly the
people she had to live amongst as Davidson&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp;
She took her pure, sensitive, mean little soul away to Fremantle
or somewhere in that direction.&nbsp; And of course the little
girl went away with her too.&nbsp; What could poor Davidson have
done with a little girl on his hands, even if she had consented
to leave her with him&mdash;which is unthinkable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the story that has spoiled Davidson&rsquo;s
smile for him&mdash;which perhaps it wouldn&rsquo;t have done so
thoroughly had he been less of a good fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hollis ceased.&nbsp; But before we rose from the table I asked
him if he knew what had become of Laughing Anne&rsquo;s boy.</p>
<p>He counted carefully the change handed him by the Chinaman
waiter, and raised his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s the finishing touch.&nbsp; He was a
bright, taking little chap, as you know, and the Fathers took
very special pains in his bringing up.&nbsp; Davidson expected in
his heart to have some comfort out of him.&nbsp; In his placid
way he&rsquo;s a man who needs affection.&nbsp; Well, Tony has
grown into a fine youth&mdash;but there you are!&nbsp; He wants
to be a priest; his one dream is to be a missionary.&nbsp; The
Fathers assure Davidson that it is a serious vocation.&nbsp; They
tell him he has a special disposition for mission work,
too.&nbsp; So Laughing Anne&rsquo;s boy will lead a saintly life
in China somewhere; he may even become a martyr; but poor
Davidson is left out in the cold.&nbsp; He will have to go
downhill without a single human affection near him because of
these old dollars.&rdquo;</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
