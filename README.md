The objectives of this assignment are to build a World Wide Web interface on top of your search engine that queries over 300 html document. The HTML front page should accept queries and call your retrieve program. The retrieve program should create an html result page which displays the top 10 documents in order, showing the document names and match-values. Clicking on the document name should bring up your copy of the document.

You may host your site on any server, but the server must be globally accessible. You may develop your web front end in any language. The design of your website (visually pleasing, re-query box on top of the results) is 20% of the grade. You do not need to become web designers, but it should be clean and attractive.

Collaboration
You may help each other out as much as you like with technical questions and debugging. However each person must write their own code, have their own url, and design their own web page(s).
